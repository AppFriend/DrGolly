### **Step 1: Create Base Branches**
Run these commands in your Replit Shell:
```bash
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev
git checkout -b test/replit
git push -u origin test/replit
git checkout main
```

### **Step 2: Create Feature Branches**
Run these commands:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/home && git push -u origin feature/home
git checkout -b feature/courses && git push -u origin feature/courses
git checkout -b feature/tracking && git push -u origin feature/tracking
git checkout -b feature/discounts && git push -u origin feature/discounts
git checkout -b feature/family && git push -u origin feature/family
git checkout -b feature/settings && git push -u origin feature/settings
git checkout -b feature/checkout && git push -u origin feature/checkout
git checkout -b feature/admin && git push -u origin feature/admin
git checkout main
```

### **Step 3: Verify Branch Creation**
```bash
git branch -a
```
