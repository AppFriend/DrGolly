**Date**: August 5, 2025, 11:19 PM
**Branch**: testing-and-updates
**Status**: Ready for deployment

## Recent Implementation Summary

### ✅ Dual User Checkout Flows Completed
- **New Users**: Email not in database → public checkout → redirect to `/complete` page for profile setup
- **Existing Users**: Email recognized → automatically logged in → redirect to `/courses` with purchase linked

### ✅ Technical Changes Made

#### Backend (server/routes.ts)
- Enhanced `/api/create-course-payment` endpoint with email-based user detection
- Auto-login functionality for existing users during checkout
- Session management for recognized users
- Response includes `userStatus` and `userId` fields

#### Frontend (client/src/pages/checkout.tsx)
- Updated payment success handling to differentiate between user types
- Enhanced routing logic based on server response
- Proper toast notifications for both user flows

### ✅ Testing Completed
- **New User Flow**: `completely-new-user@example.com` → `userStatus: "new_user_public_checkout"` ✓
- **Existing User Flow**: `existing-user-test@example.com` → `userStatus: "existing_user_logged_in"` ✓
- Both flows properly route users to correct destinations

### ✅ Database Schema
- Supports NULL `user_id` for public purchases
- Proper linking after account creation
- Course purchases tracked correctly for both flows
