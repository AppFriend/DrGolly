# üöÄ Git Workflow Demo - Step by Step Guide

## Initial Setup Complete ‚úÖ

The following Git workflow infrastructure has been implemented:

### üìÅ Files Created
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template for consistency
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Bug report and feature request templates
- `BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md` - Complete branching documentation
- `RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Release and rollback procedures
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `scripts/` - Automation scripts for common tasks

### üîß Scripts Available
- `scripts/create-release.sh` - Create stable releases
- `scripts/emergency-rollback.sh` - Emergency rollback procedures
- `scripts/switch-branch.sh` - Easy branch switching

## üéØ Demo: Creating Your First Feature Branch

Let's create a sample feature branch for adding a sleep graph to the tracking system:

### Step 1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b tracking/add-sleep-graph

# Or use our helper script
./scripts/switch-branch.sh tracking/add-sleep-graph
```

### Step 2: Make Changes
```bash
# Example: Add a new component
mkdir -p client/src/components/tracking
echo "// Sleep Graph Component" > client/src/components/tracking/SleepGraph.tsx

# Stage changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add SleepGraph component for tracking module"
```

### Step 3: Push Feature Branch
```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin tracking/add-sleep-graph
```

### Step 4: Create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub
- Create PR from `tracking/add-sleep-graph` to `dev`
- Use the PR template for consistency
- Add reviewers and labels

### Step 5: Merge and Clean Up
```bash
# After PR approval, clean up
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git branch -d tracking/add-sleep-graph
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Creating Your First Release

### Step 1: Create Release
```bash
# Create release for the Git workflow implementation
./scripts/create-release.sh git-workflow

# This creates: stable-15-07-2025-git-workflow
```

### Step 2: Verify Release
```bash
# Check if tag was created
git tag -l "stable-*" --sort=-version:refname

# Expected output:
# stable-15-07-2025-git-workflow
```

## üîÑ Branch Switching Demo

### Switch to Test Environment
```bash
# Switch to Replit test branch
./scripts/switch-branch.sh test/replit

# Deploy your feature for testing
git merge tracking/add-sleep-graph
git push origin test/replit
```

### Switch Back to Development
```bash
# Return to development
./scripts/switch-branch.sh dev
```

## üì¶ Module-Based Branch Examples

### Home Module
```bash
git checkout -b home/update-banner          # Update landing page banner
git checkout -b home/add-testimonials       # Add customer testimonials

```

### Courses Module
```bash
git checkout -b courses/video-player        # Add video player component
git checkout -b courses/progress-tracking   # Enhance progress tracking
git checkout -b courses/search-filters      # Add search functionality
```

### Tracking Module
```bash
git checkout -b tracking/sleep-graph        # Add sleep visualization
git checkout -b tracking/growth-charts      # Add growth charts
git checkout -b tracking/export-data        # Add data export feature
```

### Discounts Module
```bash
git checkout -b discounts/coupon-system     # Implement coupon codes
git checkout -b discounts/partner-api       # Partner API integration
git checkout -b discounts/expiry-alerts     # Expiry notifications

## üö® Emergency Rollback Demo

### Scenario: Production Issue
```bash
# Something went wrong with the latest release
# Roll back to previous stable version

./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh stable-14-07-2025-course-images

# This creates: rollback-to-stable-14-07-2025-course-images
# Create PR to merge this rollback branch to main
```

## üîç Branch Status Checking

### View All Branches
```bash
# Local branches
git branch

# Remote branches
git branch -r

# All branches
git branch -a
```

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Current branch and status
git status

# Recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Remote tracking
git remote -v
```

## üìã Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine
```bash
# 1. Update development branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b courses/new-feature

# 3. Start developing
# ... make changes ...

# 4. Commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature component"
```

### Evening Routine
```bash
# 1. Push daily work
git push origin courses/new-feature

# 2. Create PR if feature is complete
# Go to GitHub and create PR

# 3. Switch to test environment for testing
./scripts/switch-branch.sh test/replit
git merge courses/new-feature
git push origin test/replit
```

## üéØ Best Practices Checklist

### Before Creating Branch
- [ ] Start from up-to-date `dev` branch
- [ ] Use descriptive branch names
- [ ] Follow module naming convention

### During Development
- [ ] Make small, focused commits
- [ ] Write clear commit messages
- [ ] Test changes thoroughly
- [ ] Keep branch up to date with dev

### Before Creating PR
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
- [ ] Check for console errors
- [ ] Verify database changes
- [ ] Update documentation

### After PR Merge
- [ ] Delete feature branch
- [ ] Update local dev branch
- [ ] Test staging deployment
- [ ] Monitor for issues

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure workflow effectiveness:

- **Lead Time**: Feature idea to production
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often you deploy
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of issues
- **Recovery Time**: How quickly you fix problems

## üéâ Workflow Benefits

### Code Safety
- Protected main branch prevents accidental changes
- Required reviews catch issues early
- Automated testing prevents broken deployments

### Team Collaboration
- Clear branch naming for easy identification
- Consistent PR process for all changes
- Documented procedures for emergencies

### Release Management
- Stable release tags for easy rollbacks
- Clear versioning system
- Automated deployment pipeline
