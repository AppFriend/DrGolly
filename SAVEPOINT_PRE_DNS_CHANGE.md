- `SCRIPT_SECURITY_SYSTEM.md` - Security implementation details

### Core Application Files
- `server/index.ts` - Main server entry point
- `server/routes.ts` - API endpoints and authentication
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Frontend application entry
- `shared/schema.ts` - Database schema definitions

### Security System Files
- `scripts/script-execution-guard.ts` - Core security enforcement
- `scripts/authorized-script-runner.ts` - Secure script execution
- `AUTHORIZED_SCRIPT_USAGE.md` - Security usage guide

## PRE-MIGRATION VERIFICATION

### ✅ Server Status

- Vite development server operational
- Database connections established
- Authentication system active

### ✅ Security Verification
- Destructive scripts quarantined: ✅
- Authorization system functional: ✅
- Audit logging operational: ✅
- Emergency controls available: ✅

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Course content protected from unauthorized modification
- User data secure with proper access controls
- Backup systems in place for critical operations
- Audit trail maintaining complete activity log

## DOMAIN MIGRATION CHECKLIST

### Before DNS Change
- [x] Application fully functional on current domain
- [x] All integrations tested and working
- [x] Security systems operational
- [x] Backup procedures documented
- [x] Savepoint created

### During DNS Change
- [ ] Update domain references in authentication config
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate generation
- [ ] Test all external integrations with new domain
- [ ] Confirm email/webhook endpoints updated

### After DNS Change
- [ ] Verify application accessibility on new domain
- [ ] Test authentication flow with new domain
- [ ] Confirm Stripe webhooks receive events
- [ ] Validate Klaviyo integration continues working
- [ ] Test all user-facing features

## RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### If Issues Occur During Migration
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert DNS to previous domain
2. **Security Check**: Verify no unauthorized script execution
3. **Data Verification**: Confirm database integrity
4. **Integration Test**: Validate all external services

### Emergency Contacts
- **Admin Email**: admin@drgolly.com
- **Security Issues**: Use emergency shutdown if needed
- **Database Problems**: Check PostgreSQL connection status

## POST-MIGRATION VALIDATION

### Critical Tests Required
- [ ] User login/logout functionality
- [ ] Course content access and playback
- [ ] Payment processing through Stripe
- [ ] Admin panel operations
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Security Validation
- [ ] Script security system remains active
- [ ] Audit logging continues on new domain
- [ ] User authentication working properly
- [ ] API endpoints secure and functional

## BACKUP STATUS

### Automatic Protections
- **Database Backups**: Neon serverless automatic backups
- **Code Repository**: Git tracking all changes
- **Security Logs**: Continuous audit trail
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Available if needed

### Manual Backup Recommendations
- Document current domain configuration
- Save current environment variable setup
- Record working integration configurations
- Note any custom domain-specific settings
