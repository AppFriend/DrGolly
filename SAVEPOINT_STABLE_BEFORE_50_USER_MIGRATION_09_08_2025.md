## 🛡️ Rollback Protection Plan

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
If ANY of these issues occur during migration:
1. Authentication failures preventing user login
2. Payment processing errors or subscription access issues
3. Course content not loading or progress loss
4. Database connection failures or data corruption
5. Admin panel access problems or management tool failures

### Rollback Procedure
1. **STOP** all migration activities immediately
2. Use Replit's checkpoint rollback feature to restore this savepoint
3. Verify all systems return to pre-migration state
4. Test critical user flows (login, course access, payments)
5. Document issues for resolution before retry

### Emergency Contacts
- Primary: tech@drgolly.com (system administrator)
- Secondary: admin@drgolly.com (platform management)
- Backup: alex@drgolly.com (medical content authority)
