# SCRIPT SECURITY SYSTEM

## INCIDENT REFERENCE
**August 5th, 2025 Data Corruption Incident**
- Script: `populate-course-content.ts`
- Impact: 277 lessons completely overwritten
- Cause: Unauthorized automatic execution
- Status: User was on holiday, no authorization given

## COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. SCRIPT QUARANTINE SYSTEM
- **Original script DISABLED**: `populate-course-content.ts` → `populate-course-content.ts.DISABLED`
- **Quarantine script created**: Prevents any execution attempts
- **Security monitoring**: Active monitoring for script changes

### 2. MULTI-LAYER AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Layer 1: Script Execution Guard
- All destructive scripts require explicit confirmation
- Users must type: `EXECUTE_DESTRUCTIVE_SCRIPT_WITH_FULL_UNDERSTANDING`
- Only authorized users can execute
- Automatic backup creation before operations

#### Layer 2: Pre-Script Security Check
- Package.json scripts intercepted by security checker
- Dangerous script patterns blocked automatically
- Emergency shutdown capability

#### Layer 3: File System Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of scripts directory
- Suspicious file changes logged
- Security violations tracked in audit log

### 3. EMERGENCY PROTECTION FEATURES

#### Emergency Shutdown
```bash
# Create emergency lock to disable ALL destructive scripts
touch .script-locks/EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN.lock
```

#### Security Violation Logging
- All attempts logged to database and file system
- IP tracking and user attribution
- Incident correlation with original August 5th event

### 4. AUTHORIZED USER SYSTEM
Only these users can execute destructive scripts:
- `admin@drgolly.com`

### 5. MANDATORY SAFEGUARDS
For any destructive operation:
1. ✅ **User Authorization**: Explicit confirmation required
2. ✅ **Automatic Backup**: Pre-operation backup created
3. ✅ **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with user attribution
4. ✅ **Emergency Disable**: Can be instantly disabled
5. ✅ **Access Control**: Only authorized users

## FILES PROTECTED BY THIS SYSTEM

### Quarantined Scripts (PERMANENTLY DISABLED)
- `scripts/populate-course-content.ts.DISABLED`
- `scripts/QUARANTINE-populate-course-content.ts`

### Security System Files
- `scripts/script-execution-guard.ts` - Core security enforcement
- `scripts/script-security-monitor.ts` - Real-time monitoring
- `scripts/.script-permissions.json` - Permission configuration
- `package-scripts/pre-script-check.js` - NPM script interception

### Protection Logs
- `logs/security/security-violations-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Database: `content_audit_log` table

## HOW TO SAFELY EXECUTE CONTENT OPERATIONS

### For Authorized Users - Secure Execution Process:

#### Option 1: Authorized Script Runner (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# View available authorized scripts
tsx scripts/authorized-script-runner.ts

# Execute specific script with full protection
tsx scripts/authorized-script-runner.ts content-recovery
```

#### Option 2: Direct Secured Script Execution
```bash
# Execute with built-in security guard
tsx scripts/authentic-content-recovery.ts
```

### Multi-Step Authorization Process:
1. **Business Purpose**: Explain why the script needs to run
2. **Backup Confirmation**: Confirm automatic backup creation
3. **Final Authorization**: Type `AUTHORIZED_EXECUTION_WITH_FULL_RESPONSIBILITY`

### Security Checkpoints:
- User must be authenticated and authorized
- Multi-step confirmation required
- Automatic backup created and verified
- All actions logged with full audit trail
- Emergency shutdown capability available

## INCIDENT PREVENTION GUARANTEES

✅ **No automatic execution**: Scripts cannot run without explicit user action
✅ **Authorization required**: Only approved users can execute
✅ **Backup protection**: Automatic backups before any changes  
✅ **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all actions
✅ **Emergency controls**: Instant disable capability
✅ **File monitoring**: Real-time protection against unauthorized changes

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Unauthorized Script Execution Detected:
1. **Immediate shutdown**: `touch .script-locks/EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN.lock`
2. **Check audit logs**: Review all recent security violations
3. **Verify backups**: Ensure data recovery options available
4. **Contact admin**: Report incident immediately

### Recovery Options:
- Automatic backup files in `backups/` directory
- Audit log reconstruction from `content_audit_log` table
- Emergency rollback capability via checkpoint system

## CONCLUSION

The comprehensive security system ensures that the August 5th data corruption incident **CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN**. Multiple layers of protection, authorization requirements, and monitoring systems prevent any unauthorized script execution.

**No destructive script can ever run automatically or without explicit, authorized user confirmation.**
