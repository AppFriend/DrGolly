Introducing solids is meant to be fun, exploratory, messy, and silly. If you are anxious about what your baby is eating, how much they are eating, and what mess is being made—then your baby is far less likely to develop a positive association with solids.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In this video, Dr. Golly will talk you through the signs of developmental readiness for solids, the best way to introduce new foods, the importance of reducing allergy risk, and ways to make solids lead to better day and night sleep. Follow these steps, and Dr. Golly will have your baby sleeping 12 hours straight in no time!</span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,Signs of Readiness to Start Solids,Signs of Readiness to Start Solids,"<p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Signs your baby is ready to start solids include:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">More frequent night waking and catnapping during the day</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Your baby watching you more intently when you are eating and seeming more interested</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Reaching for food as you try to eat</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Putting objects in their mouth more often</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Babies do NOT need trunk control</strong> (i.e., sitting independently) to be able to start solids. They only need head control and can be safely fed in a ‘fitted’ high-chair, bouncer, parent’s lap, etc.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Remember,</strong> solids at this stage are considered ‘complements’ to milk, not replacements. Breast milk or formula is still the most important part of their nutritional intake, so this is an opportunity for baby and parents to learn about different smells, textures, and flavors.</span></p><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/f36/a45/68e/Dr_Golly_Templates_%283%29.png"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""Dr_Golly_Templates_%283%29.png"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div><p><br></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,How To Introduce Solids,How To Introduce Solids,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Order to introduce solids</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This following order isn’t set in stone, and every family should do what is right for them. However, I recommend starting with one meal and, once established, quickly introducing another.</span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Introduce lunch first</strong> – It is often the least stressful time of day, and you have more time to observe any reactions your baby might have to a particular food.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Introduce dinner</strong> – After a few days of offering lunch.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Introduce breakfast</strong> – Once lunch and dinner have been established for a couple of weeks.</li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Separating solids from milk</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Try to separate solids from milk (and vice versa) by 30-40 minutes to help generate an appetite. For the 4-6 month age group, milk should still be offered before solids since it provides the bulk of nutrition. However, a milk/solids/milk combination can work for some babies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">From 6-7 months, offering solids before milk at lunchtime can encourage more interest in eating. A big milk feed beforehand can reduce hunger for solids.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>What types of food to start with</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Start with purees of fruits and vegetables such as:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Sweet potato</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Pumpkin</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Carrot</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Peas</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Zucchini</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Pear</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Apple</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Banana and avocado (these don’t require cooking to puree)</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Be cautious with foods that may cause gas, like cauliflower and broccoli. Iron-fortified infant cereal is also a great first food, especially for vegetarian families since plant-based iron sources are high in fiber and need to be introduced gradually.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Introduce NEW foods regularly</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Introduce one new food at a time before combining different flavors. Offer both purees/mashed foods and finger foods to help babies learn how to manage different textures. The goal is to expose your baby to as many flavors and textures as possible while monitoring for potential allergic reactions.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Lots of parents love a list to tick off</strong> – Keeping track of foods introduced can be helpful, especially if multiple caregivers are involved in feeding. If this sounds like you see my checklist below.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Gagging</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Gagging is normal and indicates that the baby is protecting their airway by moving food that isn’t going down correctly. Parents anxious about choking may feel more comfortable offering new textures in the presence of another parent, family member, or support person. This way, they don’t delay introducing textures but still feel reassured.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Baby-led weaning</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Baby-led weaning is an approach where babies skip purees and go straight to small solids they manipulate and self-feed. Since this method requires certain developmental abilities, babies may not consume adequate solid volumes until 8-9 months.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It's important to follow each baby's lead and use a mix of traditional feeding and baby-led weaning. Encourage both pureed feeding and independent exploration of textures while ensuring close supervision, updated first aid knowledge, and a willingness to embrace the mess!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Download my starting solids checklist <a download=""HERE."" target=""_blank"" href=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1742251524636x566577088368851440/DrGolly-Starting%20Solids%20Checklist.pdf?_gl=1*s761zj*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDIxODI1OTAuQ2owS0NRanc3ZG0tQmhDb0FSSXNBTEZrNHY4cDFUWVV1eXhVNXNhQVFpNkppQ3E3RDgwRzJteUF3bDJGSFdWV2NvNlNUWmxiWXpSTVNIb2FBaFp3RUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTU4MjQ3MjU2Mi4xNzM0ODIwNjg0*_ga*OTM0MzI3MjIwLjE3MjQxMDY5OTA.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MjI1MDQ2OC40NC4xLjE3NDIyNTE1MDEuNTguMC4w"">HERE.</a></span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,Introducing Protein at Lunch,Introducing Protein at Lunch,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once your baby is 6 months old <strong>introducing protein at lunchtime will help stabilise their blood sugars overnight and help reduce night wake ups.</strong> 25-50g of a protein source should be added, these include foods like chicken, turkey, red meats, fish, egg and dairy.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> this recommendation is not at the micro nutrient level of protein you read on a food label - it's 25-50g of a <strong>protein source</strong> so just add 25-50g of your protein source of choice to their meal. e.g. 25-50g of chicken breast blended with pumpkin. What lots of families do is make simple 2-3 ingredient combos like this and freeze them in portions so it's easy to access everyday.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Prioritising protein at lunchtime is important as from 6 months of age a baby's protein requirements increase from what breastmilk and formula alone can provide. Protein can also be added to breakfast from this age too.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>From my experience protein shouldn’t be offered at dinner time until closer to 8-9 months as it can affect digestion overnight.</strong> However this doesn't affect all babies and if your baby is fine with protein at dinner you can continue to offer it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Beans and legumes</strong> are a great source of protein but shouldn’t be offered until closer to 8 months old as they can make babies quite windy. It’s also very important to include iron rich foods from this age group as around 6 months is when your baby’s iron stores start to deplete, so including meat in their diet (in particular lamb) gives your baby the benefits of a protein and iron rich source.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Ready-made baby pouches</strong> available from supermarkets are a quick and convenient option, however be aware that the amount of protein in them is minimal, and your baby is unlikely getting enough protein if just offered these.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,Tryptophan,Tryptophan,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that serves several important purposes, like nitrogen balance in adults and growth in infants. It also creates niacin, which is essential in creating the neurotransmitter serotonin which is converted to melatonin in the presence of darkness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Melatonin is our sleep hormone so a healthy production of this is important. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Foods high in tryptophan include turkey, chicken, bananas, oats, kidney beans, dairy and eggs and adding these to your child’s diet can encourage healthy sleep. Bear in mind though that kidney beans may make some babies windy so it is best to wait until closer to 8/9 months to offer these.</span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,Starting Solids and Constipation,Starting Solids and Constipation,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Remember that constipation refers to the content of the poo, not the frequency.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby passes a soft bowel action, even as infrequently as weekly, this is not constipation. Sometimes babies simply find it difficult to coordinate the muscle changes required to pass a poo. When this occurs, your baby may show signs of discomfort, and you can help them focus their attention on their bottom (anus) by using the spike of a twisted tissue to ‘tickle’ their anus while they try to push.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Iron-rich foods and the commencement of solids can sometimes lead to constipation in babies. Many formula brands also suggest switching to ‘stage 2’ versions to increase the iron content. It is perfectly safe to remain on newborn/starter versions of common formula brands, especially if flow-on versions are causing constipation.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Sometimes constipation simply happens because a child’s solids intake increases rapidly, and their digestive system isn’t quite ready to digest all of that. Other times, it can be caused by inadequate fibre or fluids. It can also be caused by excessive fructose intake. If the constipation coincides with the introduction of specific foods (e.g., yoghurt in a breastfed baby), then it can sometimes be a residual intolerance to cow’s milk protein.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I recommend a balance of foods, not just focusing on one food group, and ensuring that there is adequate fluid intake.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Cooled, boiled water should be introduced when children start on solids.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Just like all other foods, it can take some time to figure out how to drink water as it has a different viscosity than breast milk or infant formula. I encourage water to be offered in a sippy cup of some sort (lots of parents like the straw cups), but I recommend trying a few different sippy cups to find the one that suits the child best. As dexterity improves, you'll move towards an open cup—get ready for all the splashes and spills!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If constipation is still an issue for your baby, then please see your doctor or paediatrician.</span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,How Much Solid Food Should My Baby Be Eating?,How Much Solid Food Should My Baby Be Eating?,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Many books suggest giving your baby a certain amount for their solids meal, however...</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>A baby will ALWAYS let you know when they have had enough and are no longer interested.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When your baby is no longer interested, they will:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Turn away</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Purse their lips</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Become irritable and cranky</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When they are showing you these signs, don’t keep offering food. Just try again the next day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I always suggest feeding to appetite. The parent decides what solids and when, but the child decides how much. This applies at 4 months and at 14 years too!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP:</strong> Always offer meals at least 1 hour before nap or bedtime, as we don’t want your baby going to bed uncomfortable on a very full tummy.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Since starting solids, my baby has reduced their milk intake. Do you recommend cutting out a meal or decreasing the solids offered?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>A:</strong> This isn't a worry and can be quite normal. The calories and nutrients are now being replaced by food rather than milk. I don't recommend cutting out a meal, as long as your baby is sleeping consistently, is happy during the day, and meeting developmental milestones.</span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,Introducing Allergens,Introducing Allergens,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>A note before you start reading.&nbsp;</strong>As we learned in the starting solids video &amp; content - starting solids should be a fun process that both parents and babies enjoy.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The aim of the following two chapters:</strong></span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Introducing allergens</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Identifying allergic reactions</li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Is to:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Empower you as parents</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Utilize the latest research and findings to guide you on the best approach to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Understand if you’re in a potentially higher risk category</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Know how to identify an allergic reaction</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Know what to do next if your baby does show signs of a reaction</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">These chapters are not meant to make you fearful of starting solids and<strong>I definitely don’t want to over-medicalize the introduction of solids.</strong>Remember there’s a 90% chance there will be absolutely no problem whatsoever.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">With that said…</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Allergies are on the rise:</strong><br>Food allergies are on the rise in developed countries, with significant public health impact.

Remember, even if you’re in a high-risk category for allergies, there’s still a very low chance your baby will be allergic to anything.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Be empowered with all the knowledge around allergens <strong>BUT</strong> always approach starting solids with a sense of calm and fun so we can teach our babies to love food from the very beginning.</span></p>"
1.2 Introducing Solids and Nutrition,Packet Food and Pouches,Packet Food and Pouches,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Packet/pouch food is amazingly convenient - it’s affordable, sterile, mobile. It’s absolutely OK to use packet food. They are perfect for food on the run.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In order to achieve 12 hours of overnight sleep, I recommend 25-50g of a protein source at lunch.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>When it comes to packet food and pouches I always recommend you:</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>1. Read the label.</strong><br>There's often a lot of sugar (even if they are natural sugars, they are still sugar). What looks like vegetables could be 50% apple. Remember, our babies need to learn to eat a variety of flavors, and introducing one flavor/food at a time is important. We are also yet to find a pouch that has enough protein for this lunchtime feed. If you find one, tell us!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>2. Never let a baby eat straight from the pouch.</strong><br>Spoon feeding utilizes mouth muscles necessary for healthy growth and development. Additionally, toddlers can learn how to use a spoon to build fine motor skills. I always recommend using a spoon when feeding these purees. I'm not alarmist here - it's ok for toddlers to 'suck' on these pouches <em>occasionally (we've all forgotten a spoon on the run!).</em> However, make sure before they do this, they have started spoon-feeding themselves, eating finger foods, and drinking from a cup with minimal spilling before giving them to 'suck' on a pouch.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>3. Ensure texture is introduced as your baby grows.</strong><br>When food texture does not progress with the development of your baby, they are not challenged to learn how to chew. Studies have found that babies who were introduced to lumpy solids after the age of nine months ate less of the food groups at seven years old than those introduced between six and nine months old. The good news is there are now lots of baby packet foods and pouches with texture!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>4. Don't depend on pouches for their only source of fruit and veg.</strong><br>Packets and pouches shouldn't be the sole source of your baby's fruits and veggies. We want kids to accept fruits and vegetables in a variety of formats and textures! This is why the process of offering puree (to eat easily via the spoon), mash (to build texture and play with), and some soft finger food of the same ingredient when we introduce foods is so important.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Again, as we approach the starting of solids, my philosophy is to make food fun for both parents and babies - embrace the mess.</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When you're out and about, you may not want your baby covered head to toe in what they are eating - and that's absolutely fine. Use packets and pouches when you need to, but make sure your baby is getting a variety of flavors and age-appropriate textures as they develop.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Even when you're using packets, you can still give them handheld food. There are some great dissolvable vegetable sticks that can be terrific when you're still having fun but want to minimize the mess when you're out and about!</span></p>"

With intolerance, the more exposure, the more symptoms. This is different from an allergy, where even the smallest exposure triggers a reaction.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Note: Intolerances are common in both bottle-fed and breastfed babies.</em></span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The more common symptoms of intolerance include:</span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Mucus (in moderate-severe cases, blood) in the stool</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Irritability</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Eczema</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Difficulties with weight gain</li></ul><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Mucus in Poo: 💩</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">You can see mucus in the poo by its shine—if you hold the nappy together and pull it apart, you'll see strings like power lines.

For most babies, this should solve the issue. If symptoms persist, follow the list above in order.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Breastfeeding is one of the hardest jobs out there—this shouldn't be too strict. If your baby has strong weight gain, is settled, and sleeping well, there's no reason to deprive yourself of essential food. Small amounts of mucus can be tolerated.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Breastfeeding diets need to stay balanced. If you're removing food groups, talk to your GP about maintaining proper nutrition, as this is crucial for milk supply.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Once your baby's stools have been normal for a while, you can slowly reintroduce excluded foods.

Don’t stress about militant routines at this stage as every day is likely to look a bit different and this is very normal.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">You can begin starting to establish a more firm routine for your baby from about 6 weeks old and 5-6 kg.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">These needn’t be rigid times and the most important thing is to continue monitoring for your baby’s tired signs. When tired, begin your wind-down nap routine and pop them down within 10 minutes.

1.3 Routine,Tired Signs,Tired Signs,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tired signs vary from baby to baby, and it’s very normal to still be getting to know and recognise your baby’s tired signs at this age. You will generally start to see them towards the end of the suggested awake time. As your baby gets older, these tired signs may become less noticeable and less reliable. For example, as adults, we often yawn when we get out of bed in the morning, but this does not necessarily mean we are ready to go back to bed for more sleep. If your baby’s tired signs are harder to read now, then focus more on their awake time and suggested routine for their age. Your baby, however, may still exhibit the tired signs below.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><div><strong>I'm Getting Tired</strong><br></div></td><td><div><strong>I'm Ready for Bed</strong></div></td><td><div><strong>I'm Overtired</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Distant looks/stares<br></div></td><td><div>Yawning</div></td><td><div>Hysterical Crying</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Appearing bored</div></td><td><div>Eye rubbing</div></td><td><div>Arching back</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>More vocal/chatting</div></td><td><div>Pulling hair/ears</div></td><td><div>Stiff body</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Red eyebrows/eyelids</div></td><td><div>Wanting to suck and appearing</div><div>hungry</div></td><td><div>Very difficult to settle</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Starts posseting/spilling milk more</div><div>despite not being fed for some time</div></td><td><div>Making fists with hand</div><div><br></div></td><td><div><br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Jerky movements</div></td><td><div>Grizzling</div></td><td><div>​</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
1.3 Routine,Routine 4-6 Months,Routine 4-6 Months,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Our program recommends that babies this age be on 3 naps per day, with the third nap being quite short - to discourage a late bedtime. I recommend a short-long-short daytime nap routine for the reasons below, however, if your family isn’t able to adopt this routine then an alternative is a medium-medium-short nap routine. Often in this age group, the second nap begins to consolidate for babies who have previously catnapped during the daytime.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Natural nap windows occur between 9-10am, 12-2pm, and 6-7pm, where the body’s circadian rhythm and sleep hormones (primarily melatonin) are primed for sleep, so offering naps at these times is ideal. You’ll notice there is no natural nap window for the late afternoon nap. This is why the late afternoon nap can often be difficult for some babies, and letting them sleep in the pram/car/carrier here is okay.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Naps occurring at the right time make the child feel rested. Levels of cortisol, a hormone that increases with stress, dramatically fall during a nap, indicating a reduction in stress in the body. Not taking a needed nap means the body remains stressed. Brief naps or naps that are out of sync with other biological rhythms are less restful and less restorative. But a short nap is better than no nap at all.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A longer lunchtime nap is more restorative and consists of deeper sleep, leading to being less overtired at tonight’s bedtime. Apart from the late afternoon nap, try to encourage less motion-associated sleep from now on, as it is less restorative, so fewer naps in the swing/carrier/pram/car/etc.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Waking them at around 7am every day will keep their day on track for naps and provide consistency, which babies thrive on. Every routine here is specifically formulated to not just achieve a happy, well-settled baby - but also to ‘set you up’ for the next phase. To demonstrate the point: teaching your baby to have a longer lunchtime nap at 4 months makes it easier to transition them to 2 naps between 7-8 months, and also to 1 nap between 15-18 months.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP: It's so important to wake your baby from their naps if they are having longer than mentioned in the routines below. Our goal is to protect overnight sleep and also encourage the lunchtime nap to be the longest of the day, so waking them from their morning nap is the best thing to help this!</strong></span></p><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><a download=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923572208x653965483680338300/Dr%20Golly%20-%20sleep%20schedule%20-%204-6%20Months%20-%20Shortened%20Version%20Updated.pdf?_gl=1*iukj0i*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923572208x653965483680338300/Dr%20Golly%20-%20sleep%20schedule%20-%204-6%20Months%20-%20Shortened%20Version%20Updated.pdf?_gl=1*iukj0i*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" data-image-link=""image""><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/7cd/f58/4c3/Dr_Golly_-_sleep_schedule_-_4-6_Months_-_Long_Version_Updated.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""Dr_Golly_-_sleep_schedule_-_4-6_Months_-_Long_Version_Updated.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" origin-size=""2480,4713"" data-image-link=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923572208x653965483680338300/Dr%20Golly%20-%20sleep%20schedule%20-%204-6%20Months%20-%20Shortened%20Version%20Updated.pdf?_gl=1*iukj0i*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" style=""""></a></figure></div><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>You can download a printable copy <a download=""HERE"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923572208x653965483680338300/Dr%20Golly%20-%20sleep%20schedule%20-%204-6%20Months%20-%20Shortened%20Version%20Updated.pdf?_gl=1*iukj0i*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"">HERE</a></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px""><strong>4-6 MONTH ROUTINE - NO SOLIDS</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby has <strong>not yet started solids</strong>, we've altered the routine to reflect this below.

At this age, if they are taking too many calories overnight, this can affect how much they take during the day, and a milk-solids imbalance can come into play. Your baby should be on 3 solid meals by now and possibly with 1-2 snacks as well as 3-4 day milk feeds.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is waking up in the morning and not seeming interested in a full milk feed or solids, then this is a clear sign that they are having too much overnight, which is affecting their intake during the day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In our last program (Big Babies 4-8 months), we recommended dropping overnight feeds and guided you on how to do this. If your baby is still having a night feed, then it is achievable to drop this feed and teach your baby to sleep through the night.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For a full explanation, watch the video below, but as a general guide:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Breastfed:</strong> Reduce your baby’s time at the breast by 2 minutes every couple of nights until the feed is dropped.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Bottle-fed:</strong> Reduce the volume of your baby’s bottle by 30ml every couple of nights until you are down to 60ml, then drop the feed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is having 2 feeds overnight, then I recommend dropping the second feed first (usually the one between 2-5 am) and keeping the earlier feed.

The best way to stretch their wake window is to do it <strong>gradually, by adding just 10-15 minutes to each awake period, every few days.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For babies on 3 naps, the last awake period of the day may not be able to be stretched, and this can be normal. Babies will be at their most tired towards the end of the day, just like adults, and the worst thing to do here is stretch them too much and create overtiredness before bedtime. Our awake times in this program are just a guide - remember that every baby is different, and your baby might cope well with slightly shorter or longer awake times than what is recommended.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tips to help extend your baby's awake times:</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Face-to-face time with your baby with a song or nursery rhyme.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Playtime in a different room of the house - if your baby has been playing in one room of the house, then taking them to a different room for the last little bit of their awake time can distract them enough with a change of scenery.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Taking them outside in the fresh air to look at the trees and environment around them - a burst of sunshine before a nap also helps with melatonin production!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 4:</strong> A brief walk in the pram - be careful your baby doesn't fall asleep here if you're wanting them to stay awake and go to sleep in their cot/bassinet.

A power nap is a small 15-minute nap ONLY to help get your baby through to their next nap time and keep their day on track. Allowing them to only have 15 minutes may seem cruel, but we want to avoid them falling into a very deep sleep, as this will decrease their drive to sleep, making their next nap harder to achieve.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">So your morning might look something like this:<br>6 am - Wake up, unable to be resettled<br>7.15 am - Power nap<br>7.30 am - Wake baby up<br>9 am - Nap 1 back on track.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A power nap is only a temporary solution and should only be used for a few days in a row, as we don’t want it to become a new habit.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Over 5 months old:</strong><br>If your baby wakes early, try your best to stretch them out until as close to their normal nap time as possible. A little walk around the garden or playtime in a different room might help pass the time if they are more fussy and tired than usual because of the early wake-up.</span></p>"
1.3 Routine,Early Morning Waking Tips & FAQs,Early Morning Waking Tips & FAQs,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Double check why your baby might be waking - and think of hunger as the last option.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Could they be overtired or under-tired from the previous day's sleep?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Double check the age bracket your baby is in and if their day sleep matches what's in their age-appropriate routine. It can be tempting to let them take extra long naps and have some bonus time to yourself - but most likely, this will bite you in the bottom overnight.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Are they too cold?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">In my experience, this is the most common reason a baby wakes around 4am (the coldest part of the night). Double check what TOG they are wearing and the temperature of the room. If it's not 18-21°C, think about a heater option.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Are they too hot?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This is less common but still something to think about.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Is the morning light coming in and waking them up?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This is a HUGE one. If you haven’t invested in blackout blinds and your baby is waking as the sun comes up, this is probably the reason.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Could it be wind?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">See my content on colic and wind signs to dive further into this. Most of the time, due to it being the middle of the night, we don’t wind as effectively or for as long for evening or night feeds - this can lead to wind and may make them very uncomfortable in the early hours.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Is it a dirty nappy?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">It seems obvious, but if there’s a poo, you need to change it. I’m yet to meet a baby that will sleep comfortably with a soiled nappy. Most babies will handle a slightly wet nappy, but if it’s super full (if they are cold and have been having lots of overnight feeds, it probably is), you will need to change this too. Keep the lights low or off and just use the torch on your phone - calm and dark for overnight changes is the key.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Do they have eczema that could be bothering them?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Like colic, if they are uncomfortable, it will be impossible to get them to sleep. Work with your doctor to get on top of any eczema.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">And lastly, are they hungry?</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">The reason why we look at hunger last is that if a baby is fed as soon as they wake before 7am, they take in calories, which means they won't be as hungry or have as full of a feed in the morning. The cycle of too many calories overnight and not enough during the day continues - this is often referred to as <em>reverse cycling.</em> Revisit the video on dropping night feeds for more on this.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For all early morning waking, keep the lights preferably off or as low as possible and limit all interaction: this isn't the time to sing songs and chat to them, as we want to try and keep them as sleepy as possible - the less stimulation, the better.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Early Morning Waking FAQs</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. What should I do if my baby wakes before 5am?</strong><br>A. Go through the above checklist and rule out common reasons for waking. Try to resettle your baby using your chosen settling technique (chapter 1.8 - settling and calming babies). If you feel your baby is hungry, then feed as needed, as a hungry baby won't resettle. Once your baby is over 5-6kg and over 6 weeks old, then you can try to reduce this feed gradually. Please refer back to the Dropping Night Feeds video in this lesson.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. What should I do if my baby wakes between 5-6am?</strong><br>A. Go through the above checklist and rule out common reasons for waking. Try to resettle your baby using your chosen settling technique. If your baby needs a feed, then at this hour of the day, I recommend offering a half feed (either a smaller bottle or fewer minutes at the breast) and then putting them back to bed, treating it like a night wake-up. Continue to wake them around 7/7:30am (or the usual time you wake them) to start their day. As feeds help set their circadian rhythm, I suggest continuing to decrease the amount offered at this time until they're sleeping through until closer to 7am.</span></p>"
1.3 Routine,How to Drop to 2 Naps,How to Drop to 2 Naps,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Most babies are ready to drop to 2 naps between 7-8 months old, some as early as 6 months.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Signs they are ready to drop the late afternoon cat-nap include:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Suddenly waking frequently overnight, particularly between the hours of 1-3am</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Taking longer to fall asleep at bedtime</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Fighting the afternoon catnap consistently for more than 1 week</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When you drop the 3rd nap, bedtime will need to be moved earlier to help them adjust. This transition can take a couple of weeks. Move bedtime to 6/6.15pm and remember that putting them down earlier will help keep on top of overtiredness, which in turn will reduce the likelihood of overnight waking and early morning waking. They may still need a cat-nap every 2nd or 3rd day for a little while or on days where they haven’t had a long lunchtime nap.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is in childcare or looked after by a relative, then it’s really important to have <em>everyone on board with their routine.</em></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This consistency is in your baby's best interest and will help their night sleep if every day is roughly the same. I encourage you to print off or write your child’s routine down for their childcare educators or caregivers and explain why it’s important to you that they respect your baby’s routine. Of course, there will be times when your baby’s routine is thrown off, for example with travel or sickness, but having the skills and knowledge to get them back into an age-appropriate routine is the most important thing.</span></p>"
1.3 Routine,Roll-Over and Dream Feeds,Roll-Over and Dream Feeds,"<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">What is a roll-over feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A roll-over feed is suitable for late evening feeds (they work really well for some, not all babies). They involve gently waking your baby but keeping stimulation to a minimum, like ‘rolling’ one sleep into the next. Lights are kept dim, and there are minimal interactions. While a roll-over feed is likely to be smaller than a full daytime feed, it is far more filling than a dream feed.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">What is a dream feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A dream feed is a feed where your baby stays asleep or is aroused to a lighter stage of sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>These are suitable for babies over 6 weeks old.</em> You may choose to keep the stimulation to a minimum or try to maintain sleep throughout.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Roll-over vs. dream feed?</strong><br>Both are reasonable options - your baby will tell you which they prefer.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">How do I offer a dream feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This feed can be offered by both breast and bottle, and if you’re wanting to introduce a bottle into your baby’s routine, this is the perfect time to add it (I recommend this after 4-6 weeks when breastmilk supply has been established).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gently pick up your sleeping baby out of the bassinet or crib.<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Keep your baby swaddled or in their sleeping bag.<br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Position yourself comfortably as you would for any regular feed.<br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Gently tease your baby’s mouth with the nipple or bottle teat until they open enough to latch.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If it’s difficult, try stroking their cheek or lips to stimulate their rooting reflex and encourage them to take the nipple.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 5:</strong> Give your baby a bottle or breastfeed.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Some babies will only take one side of the breast or a smaller amount than they usually would in a bottle compared to a regular feed—this is normal.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 6:</strong> Make sure your baby is well-winded.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Even though it’s a quick feed, it’s important not to miss this. This will help stop them from waking in the middle of the night from trapped wind and help them sleep longer. You can absolutely burp them while they are asleep/half asleep.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 7:</strong> After a quick cuddle, put your drowsy baby back to sleep in their crib or bassinet.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds don’t work for every baby—some will wake too much and be difficult to resettle, while others just refuse to feed while still asleep. I recommend continuing to try a dream feed for at least 1 week, as it can take this long for it to be successful. Dads can offer the dream feed with a bottle, while mum goes to bed earlier for the night.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds are often much smaller and less satisfying than feeding when awake and may not give them the calories they need to sleep through until 7 am reliably. However, if your baby is sleeping through till morning with a dream feed, there is nothing you need to change!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds should not be offered past 7 months old. Disturbing their night sleep at this age can be counterproductive and actually increase night waking, so after 7 months, let your baby wake on their own for a feed overnight if needed.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tips for a successful roll-over or dream feed</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Keep the lights dim and stimulation to a minimum—try to use a hallway light or a dim, small night light to help stop your baby from waking fully.<br><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Only change their nappy if it is heavy or soiled. If necessary, change the nappy before the feed and only unswaddle their bottom half to try and keep them as drowsy and settled as possible.<br><strong>Tip 3:</strong> If offering a bottle, have it all ready to go so you don't have to leave the room to prepare it.<br><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Leave the white noise playing to help keep your baby calm and quiet.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">FAQs on the Late Night Feed</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby is going down at 7 pm and sleeps to 3-4 am. I'm hesitant to wake them for the 10 pm/11 pm roll-over/dream feed. Do I still need to wake them?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> YES, absolutely. The reason I recommend this late evening feed is that we are aiming to consolidate the nice long stretch overnight and get your baby sleeping as close to 7 am as possible. The 3-4 am feed is what we are aiming to drop first, followed by the 10/11 pm evening feed (once solids are established).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: How long should a dream feed be?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Let your baby feed for as long as they want to. It might be 5 to 15 minutes at the breast or 60-120ml in a bottle. As mentioned above, sometimes this feed isn't a full feeding because your baby is still drowsy or asleep, and this is fine.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Is breast or bottle feeding best here?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Babies can be breastfed or bottle-fed with expressed milk or formula at this feed. It's a great feed to offer a bottle at as it means mum can go to bed earlier, and dad or the non-breastfeeding parent can still offer the feed—again, taking into consideration that I don't recommend this until breastmilk supply has been established if you're breastfeeding.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: How do I know if the dream feed is working for my baby?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Dream feeds are supposed to help babies sleep for a longer stretch and be easier to put back down to bed. If this isn't happening and night wakings are continuing frequently despite trying for a week, then it might be best to let your baby wake on their own for a feed or wake them and feed at 10/11 pm instead.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds are fantastic, but in my experience, they don't work for all babies, and this is okay.</span></p>"
1.3 Routine,The Importance of Play Time in Their Bedroom,The Importance of Play Time in Their Bedroom,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A huge part of helping your baby sleep well is ensuring they feel safe, secure, and comfortable in their sleep space. For this reason, I always suggest including some playtime in their bedroom a couple of times a day to help them see their bedroom as a happy and fun place to be, and not one of fear and anxiety and a place they only go to sleep. Just 10-15 minutes a couple of times a day is all that is needed. Read some books, sing songs, take some of their favourite toys in there and make it fun. If you are still room sharing then I recommend the playtime be split between their current sleep space and also their own bedroom that they will eventually transition into.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>If your baby is already familiar and comfortable with their bedroom it will make the transition a whole lot easier!</em></strong></span></p>"
1.3 Routine,Routines On-The-Run,Routines On-The-Run,"<p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The recommended routines will give you a guide as to how your day will look; however, we appreciate that you will still need to get out of the house, sometimes during suggested nap times. While your baby is still little, it is a great time to get out and about, as generally, the younger they are, the better babies will sleep while on the go since movement can be a helpful settling tool.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It's important to note that after around 6 months of age, sleep on the go (in the pram, carrier, or car seat) is usually less restorative. Your baby will be more likely to wake after one sleep cycle and may be difficult to get back to sleep. At this age, you don’t have to offer all naps in a dark room in your baby’s bassinet or cot; however, we do suggest offering at least one nap a day at home in an ideal sleep environment (think white noise, as dark as possible, and a comfortable temperature).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Sometimes routines are disrupted and naps have to be ‘on the run’.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A good balance is the 80/20 rule—most sleep (80%) occurs in a normal sleep environment (their nursery, daycare, grandparent’s house, etc.), but on-the-go life (20%) is allowed to happen too! If sleep is disturbed or missed, remember that every morning is a chance to reset and start fresh—never be disheartened.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>FOCUS:</strong> From around 12 weeks old, the nap we want to focus on being the longest and most restorative is the lunchtime nap. This is because it helps keep overtiredness at bay and sets you up for a better night. It is also the nap your baby will continue having until they are around 3 years old, so teaching them early to have a longer nap here helps in the long term. As much as possible, offer the lunchtime nap at home in their cot and focus on resettling your baby if they wake early.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">To help your baby sleep while out and about during the day, try to recreate their sleep environment as much as possible:</span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Darken the pram with a <em>breathable blackout cover</em>. Don't use a blanket, as this doesn't usually provide enough darkness and the temperature in the pram can become dangerously high.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Use the same white noise or nature sounds</em> that you use at home. There are many portable white noise machines available that run on batteries.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is still swaddled and you want to encourage them to nap in the pram, <em>use the same swaddle</em> you do at home.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you have to head out during your baby's lunchtime nap, then occasionally offering a longer morning nap and two shorter naps later in the day is okay—but try not to make this a regular pattern. You might also notice your baby is more tired at bedtime, so don’t stretch them out—bring bedtime earlier.</li></ul><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you are going out for dinner occasionally, we recommend the following changes:</span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you are heading out to a restaurant, then giving your baby a slightly longer third nap (or a fourth nap if they haven't slept well during the day) will allow you to push bedtime out a bit. If your baby falls asleep in the car on the way home, attempt to transfer them to their cot. However, if they wake up, this is okay. Offer a small top-up feed and put them to bed.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you are visiting family or friends, try to recreate their usual sleep environment as much as possible. Make sure the room is as dark as possible, use your white noise/nature sounds, use the same swaddle or fitted cot sheet so it smells like home, and bring any comforters or dummies your baby uses at sleep time.</li></ul><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/288/27d/2fb/shutterstock_1041557752_%281%29.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1041557752_%281%29.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

Babies are top heavy (their head is disproportionately heavier than the rest of them) and when they sit in an upright inclined position like they do in a car seat or capsule it may cause your baby's neck to flex forward or chin down which may block their airway. <strong>Never</strong> leave a baby asleep unsupervised in a car seat or capsule.</span></p><div><svg><path></path></svg><svg><path></path></svg></div>"

1.3 Routine,Power Naps for Babies Under 5 Months,Power Naps for Babies Under 5 Months,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Power naps are really helpful to help keep the day on track while still establishing a routine and teaching your baby to link their sleep cycles. <strong>They are only useful for babies under 5 months though.</strong> This is because if they're offered to babies over 5 months old, it's more likely they'll completely refuse the next nap, which can end in an overtired, cranky baby and the whole day being out of sync.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Power naps can be used:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">if your baby has woken early in the morning and didn't resettle, i.e., before 6.15/6.30am</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">if your baby has woken early from a nap and didn't resettle, i.e., woke after 30 mins into the morning nap and is unlikely to make it until the next suggested nap time</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The most important thing about a power nap is that you MUST wake your baby after 15 mins.</strong> This is crucial; otherwise, they'll fall into a deep sleep at the 20-minute mark and be more likely to completely refuse the next nap. This seems cruel waking them, but it's the best thing to do to help them establish a routine and learn to link their sleep cycles.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Power naps can be assisted naps or contact naps - they don't have to be in the cot or bassinet.</strong> Because they're so brief, it's fine to help them sleep however possible.

1.3 Routine,FAQs - Routines,FAQs - Routines,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What is the cut-off wake-up time for a power nap (babies under 5 months old)?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> If your baby wakes before 6.15am, then they may need a power nap. Anything after that, and you can try to stretch them closer to their normal nap time. Remember, power naps should only be offered under 5 months old.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Is it ok to wake my baby from their naps?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, and you should! We want to make sure your baby is having the ideal amount of day sleep for their age, and this will lead to more consolidated sleep overnight. Waking them from their first nap is very important as they see that sleep as a continuation of night sleep, so if they have too long here, it can lead to increased night wake-ups and early morning rising.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I’ve noticed my baby is super crabby and seems grumpy since starting the new routine. Is this normal?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, it can be normal as your baby adjusts to their new routine. There can also be some more sleep debt initially as we teach your baby to resettle and consolidate their sleep overnight. This should be short-lived, and as sleep increases, your baby will be happier and less tired.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Why is the lunchtime nap the longest of the day?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> We want the lunchtime nap to be the longest of the day as it is the most restorative and deepest sleep. It falls within a natural nap window, which makes it easier for your baby to sleep at this time. Having a long nap here also leads to a reduction in the stress hormone cortisol and will lead to less overtiredness at bedtime, which sets your baby up for a better night’s sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What is a dream feed?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> A dream feed is a feed where your baby stays asleep or is aroused to a lighter stage of sleep. It’s often referred to as a roll-over feed. You may choose to keep the stimulation to a minimum or try to maintain sleep throughout—both are reasonable options—your baby will tell you which they prefer.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">To do a dream feed, gently pick your baby up and tease their mouth with the nipple or bottle teat until they open their mouth. Offer the feed as usual, all while keeping your baby swaddled or in their sleeping bag, and avoid changing their nappy as this will wake them fully. If offering a bottle here, try and keep the volume to under 150ml as too much at the dream feed can cause excessive wind or a tummy upset. When finished, bring your baby to a vertical position and begin the winding sequence. Babies who dream feed still need winding, but the amount of burps brought up may be less as they often do not feed as vigorously and take in as much air. Once they have been winded, simply lie your baby back down in their cot.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds don’t work for every baby—some will wake too much and be difficult to resettle, and others just refuse to feed while still asleep. I recommend continuing to try a dream feed for at least 1 week as it can take this long for it to be successful. Dads can offer the dream feed with a bottle while mum goes to bed earlier for the night.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you don’t offer a dream feed, then just waiting for the baby to wake on their own for a feed is perfectly ok too.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds should not be offered past 6-7 months old. Disturbing their night sleep at this age can be counterproductive and actually increase night waking, so after 6-7 months, let your baby wake on their own for a feed overnight if needed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I’m doing a dream feed, but my baby has started waking before the dream feed. What do I do about this?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> This is most likely from habitual hunger or overtiredness. Ensure your baby is having an early enough bedtime as per the routine in our program. Habitual hunger can develop when your baby is used to having a feed at a certain time. If your baby wakes and it hasn’t been 4 hours since their last feed, then resettle them using your settling technique. If they are still awake when it has been 4 hours, then go ahead and feed them.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: How do I drop the dream feed?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> When your baby reaches 6-7 months, it's time to drop the dream feed. This can be done in 2 ways.</span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px""><p>If your baby isn't having quite enough protein at lunchtime yet or still getting used to solids, then I suggest gradually weaning the dream feed. To do this, drop their feed volume by 20-30ml every 2-3 nights until they are having 30ml, then drop it and let them sleep through. If breastfeeding, then reduce the time offered at the breast by 1-2 mins every couple of nights.</p></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><p>If your baby is taking well to solids and having 25-50g of a protein source at lunchtime, then it's ok to attempt to drop the dream feed in one night. If they wake later in the night wanting a feed, then you might need to go back to offering the dream feed again and gradually wean it.</p></li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: We have an appointment right in the middle of my baby’s nap time. What should I do about this?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Sometimes things like this are inevitable, so just roll with it for the day and try to keep your baby’s routine on track as much as possible. Having one day that is a bit different occasionally won’t hurt your baby’s routine long-term. Giving them a little longer on these days at their other naps is ok to ensure their total day sleep is on track.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What is a happy wake-up, and why do I have to wake my baby up with one of these?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> A happy wake-up is where you enter your baby’s room and gently wake them but then open the curtains or turn on a light and make a big over-the-top song and dance about what a good sleep they had. This will teach your baby the difference between “I need to go back to sleep” or “it’s time to get up now.” If you are in the room resettling your baby and it’s their get-up time, then leave the room briefly and re-enter to do a happy wake-up. Even though they didn’t go back to sleep, give them lots of praise for staying in their cot.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Can we start our day at 6am or 8am if the recommended 7am doesn't work for our family?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Absolutely! It's always ok to do what's best for your family. However, some babies do find it harder to get into a 6-6 or 8-8 routine, and this is because of the natural nap windows we have discussed in section 1.3. As there are times during the day when babies are primed for sleep due to temperature and hormone regulation, adjusting their routines permanently can suit some babies perfectly well, but it just may not work for others. Try your best and see how your baby responds, and remember to be consistent and persistent while you attempt the change.</span></p>"
1.4 Sleep Cycles,Circadian Rhythms,Circadian Rhythms,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A circadian rhythm is the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, lasting 24 hours. The main hormone involved in this process is melatonin. Light drives our melatonin levels down, and darkness allows it to rise. This rise in melatonin is what makes us sleepy and helps us drift off to sleep each night. As light increases in the morning, cortisol begins to circulate, which is like our body’s natural coffee hit, driving wakefulness. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Babies mostly rely on their mother’s circadian rhythm but need to develop their own soon after birth. It is well established by 3 months of age, and there are many things you can do to help this process.</span></p>"

By this age, it's helpful to avoid rocking your baby to sleep for every nap, as this isn't sustainable in the long term for most parents. You’ll learn new techniques for settling that are age-appropriate and don’t involve any cry-it-out methods. We’ll also touch on pacifiers—when to use them and how to remove them when appropriate.</span></p>"
1.5 Settling Techniques,"Sleep Associations (Feeding, Rocking and Patting to Sleep)","Sleep Associations (Feeding, Rocking and Patting to Sleep)","<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There is a very important, very fundamental rule about humans: the way we fall asleep is the way we expect to wake up. It may sound silly, but if you fell asleep in your bed tonight and woke in the middle of the night in the same place, you roll over, go back to sleep - and don’t remember. But if you woke in another room - you would startle awake and look to find out how/why things have changed. Babies are the same. If they fall asleep being rocked in their mother’s arms, then at the end of a sleep cycle, they will wonder where that parent is - and be unable to stitch together multiple cycles.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Whenever possible, put your baby down sleepy, but awake.</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Many parents will report their baby only sleeping one cycle at a time - well, this is usually the reason.

1.5 Settling Techniques,Introducing Sleepy Words and a Happy Wake Up,Introducing Sleepy Words and a Happy Wake Up,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As part of any routine, even from this early age, both parents should find a phrase or some sleepy words that you can say to your baby as you put them down for sleep. It doesn’t have to be lengthy, but just a few words they will quickly begin to recognise as a sleep cue. Something like “night night, it’s sleep time now, love you”, or “it’s sleepy time now, sweet dreams”. Say your sleepy words right as you pop your baby in their cot for a sleep and repeat them once or twice before leaving them to fall asleep. If you need to resettle your baby, then repeat your sleepy words during the resettling process.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Introducing a happy wake-up will also help your baby learn to distinguish when it is time to go back to sleep and when it is time to wake up. A happy wake-up is where you quietly enter the room and wake the baby up, but then make a big fuss with lots of over-the-top praise about what a good sleep they had!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Your baby will learn that quiet, sleepy words mean it's time to go back to sleep, whilst a happy wake-up means it's time to get up and play.</span></p>"

There will be tears, but C2C is about instilling trust and reassurance; this takes time to develop.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Just like other settling techniques, it requires patience, hard work, and consistency.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">How to do it:</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 1:</strong> When putting your baby down to sleep, stay with them in their room. Sit next to the cot on a chair or on a cushion on the floor (avoid standing next to them as you should be at their level).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 2:</strong> If your baby starts crying, then use your voice and some touch to reassure them that you’re there and it’s sleep time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the baby doesn’t stop crying for a full minute (or count to 100), then pick your baby up and calm them. Try to make it a minimally-stimulating cuddle, though; minimize rocking, jiggling, or swaying.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 4:</strong> The second they stop crying, put them back down in the cot. You also have the option to continue using some shushing to keep them calm (and patting if younger than 6 months).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 5:</strong> If the cry turns into a grizzle, keep them in the cot and continue using your voice and some intermittent touch (patting if younger than 6 months).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 6:</strong> If they are still crying and fighting you while being held, put your baby back down and use your sleep words every few minutes such as “It’s sleep time now” or “night night time.” You can also use some intermittent shushing. The fighting, arching in your arms, and burrowing their head is part of them trying to go to sleep. Don’t fight a crying child; put them down if they are doing this.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you put your baby down and they cry the second they touch the mattress, wait another full minute (or count to 100), then pick them back up and repeat the process, but still ensure you’re following the times.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Over the coming days, you must start to increase the length of time between pick-ups for it to be effective. For example, on the first day, we waited a full minute; on day 2, we should wait 2 minutes; on day 3 - 3 minutes, etc. Combine this with reducing the amount of touch used between cuddles.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby continues to protest and not calm down with any pick-ups, then this is a sign that this technique isn’t suited to your baby and you may need to consider changing it.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em><strong>FAQ: How long do I try to settle my baby for at their naps before offering an assisted nap?</strong></em></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: At 4-8 months old, try to settle your baby for 1 hour before offering an assisted nap (i.e., pram, car seat, carrier, held).

1.5 Settling Techniques,Choosing a Settling Technique,Choosing a Settling Technique,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s important to choose a settling technique that you as parents can be consistent with. It’s also important to pick a settling technique that you think will fit with your baby’s temperament and also your parenting style. A baby that is used to being fed or rocked to sleep will cope better with a gentler technique such as cuddle to cot rather than spaced soothing. Whereas if this is your second baby and they are used to you being in and out of the room to settle them, then spaced soothing would be a more appropriate choice.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Try to stick to one technique for at least 4-5 days consistently,</strong> as changing techniques too often will just confuse your baby.

This is a sign that your baby will most likely benefit from a more hands-off approach like spaced soothing. Some babies really do benefit from having some space to learn to settle themselves. During the pick-ups, if your baby is fighting you and arching away, then the best thing to do is pop them down—they are telling you they need some space.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Spaced soothing</strong> - if your baby's cries become louder and more hysterical when you leave the room, then this is a sign that they may benefit from a more in-room technique like cuddle to cot.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Sleep training cycle</strong><br>Some babies will show a distinct pattern during any form of sleep training. Night sleep will often consolidate first after your baby is in an age-appropriate routine. As their bodies adjust to having more night sleep, their day naps can then become inconsistent; this is normal. Stick with the routine and messages you’re giving your baby, and their day naps will soon consolidate too. Again, once your baby has adjusted to more day sleep, overnight sleep may be thrown off again for a brief period, but these will all come together if you stay consistent. Not every baby will experience this cycle, but it is reassuring if every sleep doesn’t fall into place immediately.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td class=""""><div><br></div></td><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem""><strong>Pros</strong></p></td><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem""><strong>Cons</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: center""><strong>Cuddle to cot</strong></p></td><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Lots of touch and reassurance for baby and parent.</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">in room technique</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Better for younger babies</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Can help alleviate parents anxiety</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Good technique if still room sharing with baby</p></td><td class=""""><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Takes persistence</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Some babies too overstimulated with parents in the room</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">For some parents it’s hard to stay consistent when in the room</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Can take longer to see results</p><br></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: center""><strong>Spaced soothing</strong></p></td><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Quicker to see results if consistent</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Check in times are variable to suit parent and baby’s needs</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Not strict check in times</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Better suited for families with other children as mum/dad is out of the room for the majority</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Often less overall crying as results are seen quicker.</p></td><td><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Parents worried about crying involved</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Parents worried about long term effects of crying and “emotional damage” to child</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Some babies are better suited to a parent being in the room with them during settling.</p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem"">Harder to achieve if room sharing</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem""><br></p><p><br></p>"
1.5 Settling Techniques,Resettling,Resettling,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Settling a baby is when you initially pop them down to sleep, whereas <em>resettling</em> a baby is when you pop them back to sleep after waking early from a nap or waking during the night. No matter whether you are settling or resettling, <em>it's important to use the same technique as consistency is key</em>. The more consistent you are, the less confused your baby will be and the quicker they'll learn to self-soothe.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For example, if you have decided to use our Spaced Soothing method, then use this technique at every settle and resettle and stick with it for at least 4 days before switching techniques.

This is because a lot of the time, babies won't resettle in under 30 mins, and here we are teaching them that it's not quite time to get up yet and it's still sleep time. If they wake after one sleep cycle (40-45 mins), then I recommend resettling for a further 15 mins (or until the full hour is up). They are unlikely to go back to sleep here, but again, it's about teaching them that it's still sleep time. Once they've had the full hour in the cot, if they are awake with no signs of going back to sleep, then leave the room briefly and come back in with a happy wake-up.

1.5 Settling Techniques,A Note on Crying,A Note on Crying,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Regardless of which settling technique is chosen, there is bound to be some crying as the baby adjusts. It’s important to remember that this is not because your baby feels abandoned or unloved, but rather because your baby is tired or perhaps frustrated that expected reactions are not taking place. The crying should be interpreted as a protest, as opposed to pain or suffering. Babies will often protest at the changes we are making to help them learn to sleep more soundly.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I would never expect you to leave your baby or child to ‘cry it out’ and, in fact, I would never recommend others do something that I couldn’t do with my own children. This program is about tuning in to your parental instinct, listening to your baby, and choosing a technique that you can be consistent with. I want to show you what your baby is capable of (it’s often far more than we think!) and the best methods to achieve this.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">With the settling techniques recommended, make sure you choose one that is achievable for your family! Every parent and family is different, but both caregivers should be on the same page to give your baby the same, consistent message.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Controlled crying has never been researched in children under 6 months of age. It should not be used under this age, and even beyond 6 months, it remains controversial. Capped comforting is okay in smaller babies, involving a more hands-on approach. Spaced soothing is a far more gentle approach than controlled crying and is easier on babies AND parents!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Why does my baby cry when I put them to bed?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It takes all babies a different amount of time to stop crying at bedtime. Some seem to never do it, while others take a couple of weeks to adjust. I recommend lots of playtime in their room during the day so they see it as a positive, happy place to be. If they start crying when you take them into the bedroom to put a sleeping bag on, then I suggest doing this in a different room for a few days.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s very normal for babies to seem more tired and distressed during sleep training, which is why I suggest lots of extra cuddles and happy play together during awake time.

1.5 Settling Techniques,FAQs - Settling Techniques,FAQs - Settling Techniques,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: If my baby is happy and chatting in their cot do I still go in and settle them?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: No, only intervene if your baby is upset. At the end of the day we can’t force them to sleep, so giving them some time to try and fall asleep and work it out themselves is the best thing to do. Remember that cot time is still rest time.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What is the difference between settling vs resettling?</strong><br>ANS:<br><strong>Settling:</strong> putting your baby down for sleep either at nap time or evening bedtime.<br><strong>Resettling:</strong> trying to get your baby back to sleep if they have woken early from a nap or overnight.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby has been settled for 2-3 weeks after using the spaced soothing method. However, recently they have needed some resettling again, do we start back at day 1 again or continue where we left off?</strong><br>ANS: Start back at day 1 however as your baby will be familiar with this settling technique it's ok to progress a little quicker or space out the timings more than when first using it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I'm feeling overwhelmed at tackling both day naps and overnight sleep. Is it ok to work on one thing at a time or will this confuse my baby?</strong><br>ANS: Yes, it's ok to work on one thing at a time! Just do what you can, and often by working on day naps first, for example, overnight sleep improves dramatically as your baby isn't as overtired, and vice versa.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: How long do I try to settle my baby for at their naps before offering an assisted nap?</strong><br>ANS: At 4-8 months old try to settle your baby for 1 hour before offering an assisted nap (i.e. pram, car seat, carrier, held). This sounds like a very long time but remember that the first couple of days are the hardest. Try to stay as consistent as possible and persist with your chosen technique for 4-5 days. However, if you are seeing excessive crying then see Chapter 1.5 - Choosing a settling technique.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby has learned to roll from back to tummy and cries out during their sleep when they wake up on their tummy. What can I do about this?</strong><br>ANS: This is a very common issue, and the best thing you can do is to help reassure your baby that it's ok for them to sleep on their tummies, as long as they <em>get themselves</em> into that position. Never put a baby down to sleep on their tummy, however, if they've learned to roll and they are unswaddled, then if they wake and are upset, reassure them and attempt to resettle them while still on their tummies. If they're not resettling and you need to turn them over onto their back this is ok, but continue trying to resettle them whilst on their tummy and they'll get used to sleeping in this position.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Ensure lots of playtime and tummy time on the mat during the day to encourage their development and help them master the skill of rolling. It's very normal for any developmental milestone like this to affect sleep, but it does pass as they get better at it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: At the lunchtime nap when I'm resettling my baby, if they have been resettled for 40-60 mins and they finally fall asleep, do I wake them at the suggested wake-up time in the routine? Or can I let them sleep a bit longer seeing as they took a while to resettle?</strong><br>ANS:<br><em>If your baby is still having 3 naps</em>, I suggest letting them have a full sleep cycle of sleep (40-45 mins), then waking them with a happy wake-up and continuing on with your day. You'll most likely need to wake them to squeeze in a third nap, otherwise, they'll most likely be overtired and cranky by bedtime. i.e. Wake them at 3pm to ensure they can fit in a brief 3rd nap at around 4.45pm.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>If your baby has dropped to 2 naps</em>, then you can let them sleep for longer to help get them through to bedtime. i.e. Let them sleep until 3.30pm.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: We started working on overnight sleep and this technique worked really well. We're now ready to tackle daytime naps. Do we go back to the original timing or continue what we're on overnight?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">​<strong>ANS:&nbsp;</strong><span style=""color: rgb(91, 91, 91)"">Start back at the original timing you began with, but as your baby will be used to this technique it's ok to progress a bit faster and increase the timings to what they're used to.</span></span></p>"

1.6 Role of the Non-Breastfeeding Parent,FAQs - Non-Breastfeeding Parents,FAQs - Non-Breastfeeding Parents,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do I do if the non-breastfeeding parent is away overnight?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: Breastfeeding mums ask me all the time what they’re meant to do if dad’s not home or away for work—and they need to resettle their baby when trying to establish a new routine. The best thing you can do is put on one of the non-breastfeeding parent’s shirts or jumpers, masking the smell of breastmilk and letting the baby think it’s not mum coming to feed.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do we do if the non-breastfeeding parent is regularly away from home with a FIFO (fly in, fly out) role, for example?</strong><br>ANS: When sleep training and introducing a new routine, consistency is always key, but this can be tricky for some families. If the non-breastfeeding parent is away regularly, I still recommend the baby be settled by them as much as possible. In some cases, this would mean the breastfeeding mother does 3 nights a week (masked in their partner’s top—see above) and the non-breastfeeding parent does 4 nights a week. If in a FIFO role, I recommend implementing the routines and new settling techniques in a period when both caregivers are home for a week together, and the non-breastfeeding parent remains the key settler whenever they are home.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do I do if I’m a single breastfeeding parent? Can the Dr. Golly Sleep Program still work for me?</strong><br>ANS: The answer is yes. Selecting consistent routines and settling techniques while following the winding and nutrition advice in the program should help you achieve great outcomes—it just might be a bit tougher and take a bit longer to achieve the desired results. If you have signed up for the program because your baby is particularly unsettled, this is a great opportunity to ask for help from loved ones. Exhaustion and stress are two key factors that dramatically reduce milk supply, and hungry babies tend to be very unsettled. Having someone stay with you for a week while you implement a new routine and have them do the overnight settling may be incredibly helpful for both your physical and mental health.</span></p>"

In this section, I'll talk you through the different types of vomit and spills and walk through the difference between refluxed milk and a reflux diagnosis.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Reflux exists, but not as commonly as most people think.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Before you continue reading, I want everyone to approach the topics of reflux, reflux diagnosis, and reflux and sleep with caution. A reflux diagnosis in babies is a really serious condition that needs to be treated. We’ll discuss in this article what I believe to be a widespread misunderstanding of the condition of reflux and an over-diagnosis and, in my opinion, an over-medication of the condition.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Infant reflux has wrongly become the go-to, rapid explainer of unsettled behavior in babies.</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A true diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), depending on where you are, is not particularly common. There’s some really terrible language we use around babies and newborns that adds to this confusion and leads to overdiagnosis/medication.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The difference between “refluxed milk” and a diagnosis of “gastro-oesophageal reflux disease” (GORD)</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Many people incorrectly refer to small amounts of “refluxed milk,” “spills,” “up chucks,” or “possets” of milk as a reflux diagnosis or signs of reflux in babies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Small spills or possets of milk by a happy, growing baby are completely normal. They don’t cause unsettledness and don’t require specific investigation or management. Nearly all babies will posset milk from time to time (see why babies reflux milk below). Some healthy babies posset LOTS of milk – you’ll identify their parents with a cloth over their shoulder or up-chucked milk down the front of their shirts. These babies are gaining weight and are settled – you may hear me refer to these babies as “happy spitters.”</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Why babies ‘reflux’ milk</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When a baby feeds, the stomach becomes over-stretched, especially if it is full of milk and wind. Any muscle in the body desires to return to its original size and will therefore rebound back, much like an untied balloon deflates rapidly when released.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In babies who reflux a significant amount of milk, the lower esophageal sphincter muscle is often not fully developed and lets the stomach contents back up the esophagus.

"1.7 Winding, Burping and More",FAQs - Winding and Burping,FAQs - Winding and Burping,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. When are babies able to burp themselves and the winding process isn’t a thing anymore?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: This can last for many months but babies slowly get better at winding themselves, the longer they spend upright. Also, as they take larger volumes of solids - the need for winding subsides.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. How do I manage burping when my baby is pulling off frequently?</strong><br>ANS: The most common reason a baby pulls off after a few short sucks is due to the gastro-colic reflex, as highlighted in the program. Trapped wind from the previous feed causes cramping in the colon, as soon as the stomach starts to fill with milk from the current feed. While you may need to offer a quick burp each time they fall off the breast/bottle, it’s important to understand that your baby is telling us they needed to burp more at the previous feed. Hopefully, when they are fully winded at this feed, you’ll enter into a nice rhythm/cycle and see them sucking for longer periods of time at future feeds, so this becomes less of a problem.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Do I burp after each boob/bottle suck?</strong><br>ANS: Yes it’s important to offer a burp after each side or break during a bottle feed. The goal is to get up as much wind as possible to prevent unsettledness in the coming hours. You don’t have to offer the full 15 mins of winding after each small break, but at least offer the full 15 mins at the end of the feed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Is there a certain number of burps we should be aiming for in a feeding session?</strong><br>ANS: There's no magic number of burps as some are larger than others. That's why I like to devote a certain time period of time to winding.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Do certain foods make breastfed babies more gassy?</strong><br>ANS: They certainly do! Things that make us gassy will also make babies gassy. Like broccoli or beans. Babies also sometimes struggle with spice, garlic or onion.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. We only get a maximum of 1-2 burps per 15 mins. If this happens in the first 5-10 mins can we stop there or still need to continue for the full 15?</strong><br>ANS: The answer is yes - always respond to your baby. If they bring up all their wind in the first five minutes then there's no need to continue winding for another ten minutes.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. How important is the 2 minutes down 1 minute up?</strong><br>ANS: Similar to the question above, always respond to your baby, if you are achieving great burps with say 1 minute down and 30 seconds up and your baby is showing no signs of discomfort from trapped wind then that’s great. If you’re struggling to get burps up then the 2 minutes down 1 minute up for 15 minutes is really important.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Should the burp sound be loud &amp; obvious?</strong><br>ANS: Your baby burps can be loud like Homer Simpson or a small whimper, all are bringing up air but definitely not the same amount. It’s important to wind thoroughly using the active winding technique and to always be trying to read your baby for signs of trapped wind, remember these may not be immediate and you’ll often see the associated unsettledness in the hours to come.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Is a little spew / spit up classed as a “burp”?</strong><br>ANS: Yes - sometimes a big bubble of gas can carry a small posset above it, this is no problem (other than the mess!).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. The active winding method requires baby to be horizontal, but my baby squirms and cries when horizontal after a feed then when picked up has vomited. Is there an alternative to having the baby lay fully flat horizontal?</strong><br>ANS: You can keep your baby upright for a few minutes, before beginning the method. When flat, try cycling the legs, rubbing the tummy, interacting playfully or using a dummy, to try to get them as calm as possible. Remember, small possets don't matter, as long as baby is gaining good weight.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. My baby is so hard to burp, I'm lucky to get one in 15 mins. It's making night wakings so much longer and I'm exhausted. Any advice?</strong><br>ANS: Some babies are certainly harder to wind than others. If your active winding technique is right and you're devoting time to it after <strong>every feed</strong> but still not getting more burps after a week, I'd consider adding a colic mix to help the wind out more easily.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. What colic mix do you recommend?</strong><br>ANS: As a paediatrician, I remain brand-agnostic when it comes to medicines, homeopathics and listed pharmaceuticals. There are a number of different products on the market, including simethicone, dicyclomine, belladonna, hyoscyamine and dozens more. It’s important to discuss these with your child’s doctor or paediatrician before administering any, due to potential side effects.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Can nipple shields increase the amount of air my baby swallows and make them more uncomfortable?</strong><br>ANS: No, if your baby is attaching correctly around the shield this should not be any different to a bottle or a breastfed baby - that is, they will all take in some air and burping them after every sucking period is essential. I always recommend hand expressing some milk into the top of the shield so that the first mouthful is milk not air.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Can I burp a sleeping baby?</strong><br>ANS: I’m so glad you asked - the answer is YES! Many parents particularly in the first 6 weeks find their baby is showing tired signs as before they have finished their active winding periods…and they know there are still a burp or two more they need to get up. My advice here is to swaddle them up, get them into the cot lying flat, if they are dozy or fully asleep you can still pick them up gently after a couple of minutes and get that last burp or so out. I often did the late night 10/11pm feed. I’d put them down, go clean my teeth and then come back to get that last burp…it’s sooo satisfying!!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Is the cot mattress too soft to use active winding technique?</strong><br>ANS: For the full active winding method the cot mattress isn’t ideal - but if it’s just for the last burp as your baby drifts off to sleep, then it’s absolutely fine - see my notes above.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. My baby is very upset during the 2 mins down on the mat. Is it ok to use a dummy/pacifier to help soothe him during this time?</strong><br>ANS: Yes, it is ok to use a dummy during the 2 mins horizontal time while winding to help keep your baby calm. However, remove the dummy before bringing them up to the vertical position. Every few days try without the dummy during winding to see how your baby goes</span></p>"
1.8 Development,General Development,General Development,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This age group marks a huge change in how your baby is developing in terms of their gross motor skills. Babies between 4-8 months will become more aware of their body, often learning to roll back to front and front to back consistently, sit up unaided, commando crawl and some will also crawl on all fours and pull themselves to the standing position.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">All this development means their brains are on overdrive and this can have a big impact on sleep. If your baby is waking during the night to have a ‘cot party’ and are quite happy practising their new skill then the best thing you can do is just leave them be. Usually, babies will get tired and pop themselves back to sleep. If they get upset then that is when it’s a good time to start using your settling technique to teach them it’s time to go back to sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As we’ve discussed throughout this program, once your baby is rolling it’s no longer safe to have them swaddled and you need to transition them to sleeping with their arms free. Always be sure to place your baby down for their sleeps on their back, however, if they roll themselves onto their tummy and are content in that position, then it’s ok to leave them like that. If your baby becomes upset or ‘stuck’ in a position they aren’t happy with they’ll be sure to let you know about it and you can help them return to their back.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Encourage the practice of any new skill during the day. The more they do it during the day, the quicker they will get the hang of it and be less likely to get ‘stuck’ or bothered during a sleep.</span></p>"
1.8 Development,Weight,Weight,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I’ve seen thousands of babies over the years, brought to me due to concerns about dropping weight centiles. It’s a very necessary thing to be reviewed by a doctor, because dropping weight centiles - and even more concerning, dropping weight - can be a sign of poor growth and possible underlying problems.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s very distressing for parents, but it’s important to know that it can also be a very normal phenomenon. Many babies might be putting on weight adequately, but dropping centiles from a birth centile - for example, 40th - to a 6-week centile of 25th. Very often, this is what I refer to as a weight correction (see section on weight correction in 2.0 Little Baby).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When in utero, the baby’s weight is determined by the function of the placenta, adequate intake through the umbilical cord and the mother’s blood sugar levels. Babies can sometimes be born larger - or smaller - than expected. But once the baby is born, that sugar supply drops and they’re more able to regulate their calorie intake, they are bound to drop their weight centile accordingly. Similarly, babies born smaller due to a poorly functioning placenta or umbilical cord will often display excellent ‘catch-up’ growth and increase centiles accordingly.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The point is that there are many factors at play that determine the birth-weight of a baby and therefore the initial centile. But that may not be the ‘genetically predetermined’ (or likely) centile that baby was always going to be on. As they achieve a ‘correction’ in their weight centiles, we often see them gaining weight - but dropping centiles. Once reviewed by a doctor, you can trust that this is ok and not a cause for concern in most babies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once the weight correction is complete, babies tend to oscillate around a certain centile but generally continue to grow quite consistently. If we watch their centiles too closely however, usually by measuring weight too frequently, babies often appear to be reaching a plateau or dropping centiles again.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Serial (frequent, regular) weight measurements can often induce much anxiety. Once the baby has realised their ‘genetic centile’ then they often shift between 10 centile points above/below this over time. This is because babies go through periods of ‘rapid growth’ (less interest in food, smaller volumes consumed, more sleep, marked increase in length, weight plateau) and periods of ‘energy storage’ (high food intake, increase weight, less sleep). Babies grow like an accordion - first they grow ‘out’ and then they grow ‘up’ - once we understand this, we do not stress about a week of poor weight gain, because we trust that next week’s will likely be far better.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Also take into consideration your baby’s energy intake and output. A baby who has just learned to crawl, for example, might be moving more than ever, expending a huge amount of energy and this might explain a brief drop on the centile chart.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you have noticed a significant centile drop or multiple centile reductions over many weeks, have your child reviewed by a doctor.</span></p>"
1.8 Development,Unswaddling,Unswaddling,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As discussed, swaddling helps turn on your baby’s calming reflex and protects them from the startle reflex, so un-swaddling too soon can cause an increase in sleep disturbances. There are no strict guidelines on when to unswaddle your baby, and many babies will wriggle free of their swaddle independently.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">All babies should be unswaddled by 6 months or earlier if they have begun rolling from back to front. Once rolling, it becomes unsafe to continue swaddling them.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">30% of babies are unswaddled by 4 months</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">50% by 6 months</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">20% need to be unswaddled in the 6th month for their safety</li></ul><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Tips on weaning from the swaddle:</em></span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">There are many transitional swaddles available that help make the process easier.

1.9 Teething,When Does Teething Start?,When Does Teething Start?,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Teething begins earlier than most parents think - usually around 4 months of age, sometimes earlier. The discomfort of teething is mostly caused by the tooth progressing through the gum, not the actual eruption. So your baby might display fussiness, discomfort, a red cheek, disturbed sleep, hypersalivation, etc - long before they ‘cut’ a tooth.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There is a <strong><em>huge variation</em></strong> in when each child cuts their first tooth. Teething can affect sleep due to the discomfort it causes. Some babies are more bothered by teething than other babies, but if teething pain hasn’t bothered your baby during the day then it is unlikely to bother them just at night. If your baby is cranky and irritable from teething during the day then they are more likely to be woken from it overnight.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">An individual baby tooth will usually only cause discomfort for a 24-hour period, but it can take longer for some babies. The “teething process” of a tooth coming through is said to take about 8 days – 5 days prior to eruption and 3 days after eruption. It’s really important if irritability and discomfort are ongoing and you don’t see any teeth come through that you get your paediatrician or GP to review – in my experience, teething is blamed for a LOT of unsettled behaviour when it’s not the actual cause.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/871/65e/345/1615664950579.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""1615664950579.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.9 Teething,Signs and Symptoms,Signs and Symptoms,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Excessive drooling:</strong> Increased saliva production is a common teething sign, which can sometimes lead to a rash on the chin.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Irritability:</strong> Teething can make your baby irritable, fussy, and prone to mood swings.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Chewing and biting:</strong> Babies may chew on objects or try to bite things to relieve the pressure on their gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Gum swelling and sensitivity:</strong> You may notice redness, swelling, or tenderness in your baby’s gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Sleep disturbances:</strong> Unfortunately, other teething symptoms include an extra fussy baby that can have disruptions to their regular bedtime routine. Baby wakes because teething discomfort often peaks at night, leading to disrupted sleep patterns for babies and parents – the great news is each tooth is only a 24-hour cycle, so it’s relatively short-lived (I appreciate it doesn’t feel like this when you’re in the thick of it).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Loose bowels and associated nappy rash:</strong> New teeth coming through can cause hypersalivation (excessive drooling) and therefore diarrhoea and loose bowels. Teething itself doesn't cause nappy rash, but the sensitive skin around their bottoms is more likely to be affected by diarrhoea and loose bowels.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Note:</strong> Teething will NOT increase a baby's temperature above 38 degrees. Do not attribute a temperature &gt;38 degrees to teething, there is likely a medical cause that should be evaluated.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/4fe/8a5/22f/1711426209362.png"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""1711426209362.png"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.9 Teething,Tips to Help Your Teething Baby,Tips to Help Your Teething Baby,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 1: Chilled teething rings or teething toys</strong>Give your baby a clean, chilled teething ring, some teething toys, or a chilled damp washcloth to gnaw on. The cold sensation can reduce inflammation, help numb their gums, and provide relief. Ensure the toy or teething ring is age-appropriate and free from small parts to prevent it from becoming a choking hazard for your child.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re using a washcloth option, soak it in breastmilk or formula, make a ball, and tie a rubber band around the middle so they have something to hold onto.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 2: Gentle gum massage</strong><br>Wash your hands thoroughly and use a clean finger to massage your baby’s gums gently. This can help alleviate some of the discomfort and provide soothing relief where their teeth are coming through their gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 3: Pain relief options</strong><br>Consult your baby’s paediatrician or doctor about pain relief medications that are safe for your baby’s age. Always follow your doctor’s recommendations regarding dosage and usage.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 4: Dietary adjustments</strong><br>If your baby has started solid foods, offer cold and soft foods like yogurt, pureed fruit, or chilled cucumber. The coolness can provide relief to sore gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 5: Baby’s bedtime routine</strong><br>Establish a calming bedtime routine to help with nighttime fussiness that includes activities such as a warm bath, soft lullabies, and cuddling. A consistent routine signals to your baby that it’s time to sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 6: Distraction</strong><br>Engage your baby in gentle play or story time before bedtime to divert their attention from teething discomfort. Distraction can help them relax and fall asleep more easily.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 7: Comfort items</strong><br>If your baby has a favourite stuffed animal or blanket, make sure it’s within reach. These comfort items can provide a sense of security. Please ensure this is age-appropriate from a SIDS/safety perspective.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 8: Monitor nighttime nappy changes</strong><br>If your baby is in discomfort due to teething, try to minimise nighttime nappy changes to avoid waking them unnecessarily. Use high-absorbency nappies to reduce the chances of leaks.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 9: Consult your paediatrician or doctor</strong><br>If your baby’s teething discomfort is severe and persists for an extended period, or if you have concerns about their sleep, don’t hesitate to consult your paediatrician or healthcare provider who can also help your baby. They can provide guidance and tips and rule out any other potential issues.</span></p>"
