The fundamentals remain the same and economies of scale do exist, but it can certainly be challenging to juggle everything at once. Dr Golly will take you through the juggle and maintain the focus on nourishing the emotional needs of parents. Twins have an added bonus of deriving comfort from the closeness of their ‘womb-mate’ and this often helps them to sleep longer, meaning the ideal routine is far closer than you might think.</span>​<br></p>",
1.1 Sleep Environment,Cot Position,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The American Academy of Pediatrics and Red Nose Foundation recommend room-sharing for the first 6-12 months of your baby’s life as this has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS and makes it easier to comfort, feed and watch your baby.Babies are incredibly noisy sleepers and these sounds often wake parents, when the child is still sleeping. While room sharing, sometimes moving the cot to the other side of the bed where the non-breastfeeding parent is sleeping, or at the end of the bed can be helpful as your baby is less likely to smell the breastmilk, or be woken by your movements.</span></p>",
1.1 Sleep Environment,SIDS,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Remove any distractions above your baby’s cot such as mobiles or wall hangings.

1.1 Sleep Environment,White Noise,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Babies and toddlers LOVE white noise and it will become a very positive sleep association for them</strong>. At this age it isn’t necessarily soothing for toddlers (like it is for younger babies), but serves instead to drown out external noise. It is particularly useful if there is another sibling in the house, or loud noise emanating from outside.&nbsp;It is inexpensive, easy and portable. There are many free apps available from the Itunes store that create these sounds. There are also sound machines available from baby stores and online, both battery operated and mains powered. These offer true white noise but also nature sounds such as rain, ocean sounds and more. If your toddler has never had white noise played before then I suggest starting with nature sounds as these are more gentle.&nbsp;Whichever you use, it should be played at a medium level for every sleep, for the entire duration of sleep, even overnight.</span></p>",
1.1 Sleep Environment,Room Temperature and Dressing Your Baby,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The ideal room temperature for a baby is between 19-22 degrees. Dressing your baby appropriately is key to ensuring a good night’s sleep and them not waking from being too hot or too cold. Babies commonly wake from being cold as the temperature drops in the early hours of the morning.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>What is a tog rating and how does it help you dress your baby appropriately?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A TOG (""Thermal Overall Grade"") is a way to measure the insulation and warmth of sleepwear and bedding. The lower the TOG rating, the lighter the fabric. The higher the rating, the more padded it is for warmth and is more suitable to cooler temperatures. When buying sleepwear like swaddles, sleeping bags, sleepsuits, or bedding, look for TOG-rated products. These are most helpful as your baby cannot regulate their temperature like adults can and give you a better guide compared to something being a “winter weight” or “summer weight.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Keep in mind an adult’s winter duvet is generally rated between 10.5-13.5 TOG and a summer duvet between 2.5-7 TOG.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>NOTE:</strong> All babies sleep differently just like adults; some run cooler and some hotter. The below table is a guide only, and sometimes trial and error is needed to work out what your baby prefers.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP</strong><br>Does your baby always sleep on their tummy curled up with their legs underneath them? Or wet through their nappies overnight? These are signs your baby might be cold overnight. Try adding another layer or bumping up the room temperature slightly to see if that helps. This is based on anecdotal evidence only and not peer-reviewed research.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><a download=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923579368x327363865785010900/DrGolly-What%20to%20wear-TOG%20chart-Extended.pdf?_gl=1*962y19*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923579368x327363865785010900/DrGolly-What%20to%20wear-TOG%20chart-Extended.pdf?_gl=1*962y19*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" data-image-link=""image""><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/926/316/afe/1718882925758.png"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""1718882925758.png"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" data-image-link=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923579368x327363865785010900/DrGolly-What%20to%20wear-TOG%20chart-Extended.pdf?_gl=1*962y19*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" style=""""></a></figure></div><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>DOWNLOAD OUR 'DRESSING YOUR BABY' GUIDE <a download=""HERE"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923579368x327363865785010900/DrGolly-What%20to%20wear-TOG%20chart-Extended.pdf?_gl=1*962y19*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"">HERE</a></strong></span></p>",
1.1 Sleep Environment,Darkness,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It is crucial to make your toddler’s sleep environment as dark as possible. This is to optimise their melatonin production. Melatonin is our sleep hormone and it is produced in the presence of darkness, so any light coming in - can interfere with its production, leading to cat napping and difficulty falling asleep and/or linking sleep cycles. Having a darkened room will also help your toddler be less distracted when they come into a lighter stage of sleep. Shadows and objects around the room are harder to see and your toddler will be more likely to drift back off into another sleep cycle if the room is dark.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>I</em></strong></span><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>deally it should be dark enough so that you shouldn’t be able to see your hand in front of your face.</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There are many blackout blind options available, both permanent and portable, and window films that are better for oddly shaped windows. Overnight it should be very dark too, so avoid using night lights or lamps at this age (fear of the dark does not usually occur this young, and is more commonly a problem over 2-2.5 years old). If your toddler is having a nap while out in the pram (preferably only their morning nap as we only want them to have a short 20-30 minutes here), using a breathable blackout cover will help reduce external stimulation.</span>​</p>",Content from toddler program 
1.1 Sleep Environment,Car Seat Safety and Sleep,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Red Nose Australia and the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) don't promote sleeping in car seats for long periods of time due to the increased risk of SIDS. Babies are top heavy (their head is disproportionately heavier than the rest of them) and when they sit in an upright inclined position like they do in a car seat or capsule it may cause your baby's neck to flex forward or chin down which may block their airway. <strong>Never</strong> leave a baby asleep unsupervised in a car seat or capsule.​</span></p>",

1.1 Sleep Environment,Thoughts on SNOO Cots,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em><strong>Seldom does a consulting day go by without someone asking my opinion regarding the Snoo.</strong></em>&nbsp;This space-age bassinet was designed by a US paediatrician to simulate settling methods (swaddling, rocking, etc) intended to elongate a baby’s sleep and help them overcome unsettled behaviour. For many sleep-deprived parents, this provides a much-needed respite from frequent feeds and excessive crying.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em><strong>Essentially, it’s a robotic night-nanny responding to your baby’s cry volume, rocking and shushing your baby through the night.</strong></em></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Aside from the hefty price tag, there are also fears regarding security, with US embedded-device security firm RedBalloon recently hacking a Snoo via WiFi, to make it shake violently, to highlight security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, although pitched to reduce the incidence of SIDS, the actual SIDS guidelines continue to recommend an empty cot/bassinet with a firm mattress; no gimmicks.Also, although there’s no current evidence for harm regarding radiation exposure, I remain somewhat reluctant to have so much gadgetry around a newborn baby.Finally, and most importantly, the Snoo misses the point.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Put simply, if your baby needs constant resettling, then there is something being missed that’s causing this unsettled behaviour.&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The key is to identify it, then remedy it. Once this is done, you won’t need any robots to hush your baby through the night.I see countless babies with untreated causes of unsettled behaviour, from colic to eczema, protein intolerance to reflux, and everything in between. I deeply believe that glossing over these treatable conditions does a disservice to babies.Prevention is the key, so yes - babies should/can snooze without SNOOs.******<strong>FAQ: What if I’ve already spent a fortune on a SNOO and I’m using it to settle my baby?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’ve already purchased a SNOO do not despair - you are not a bad parent, quite the contrary, you’ve invested in something to create an ideal environment for your baby, you’re a FANTASTIC parent!&nbsp;What I want you to be conscious of is monitoring your baby for cues of wind and all the other reasons that could be causing them to be unsettled.&nbsp;The aim is to do our very best to listen to them, to watch them and understand what they are telling us, so that we can help alleviate causes of discomfort.The other aim prior to 6 weeks is to create healthy sleep foundations, in the first 3 weeks of life you can cuddle or rock your baby as they drift off to sleep - don’t worry about negative sleep associations in this period, just enjoy the bonding time.After 3 weeks we want to start creating healthy sleep foundations - e.g. our babies being put down sleepy, but not asleep; allowing them to fall asleep independently. Remember, they are still learning at this point, so if you’re turning the SNOO off or down for even one sleep a day - that’s a terrific start.To recap - you’re a great parent, never forget this! Always look for the cause of the unsettled behaviour so you can prevent it - rather than mask it - and work towards independent settling in time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>FAQ: I’m using the SNOO and I'd like to wean my baby off it, what do you recommend?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">At the Dr Golly program we believe weaning off the Snoo bassinet as soon as you can, or even better, avoid using one in the first place. As discussed above SNOO bassinets can mask unsettled behaviour and if your baby needs constant resettling, then there is something being missed.&nbsp;The key is to identify why your baby is unsettled, then remedy it. Once this is done, you won’t need any fancy bassinets to rock your baby through the night.If you are already using a SNOO, then we recommend using the wean function for few days, before using it as a bassinet only, turning off the rocking feature.&nbsp;If your bub has been in the SNOO for a while, then it’s normal to take a little longer to wean off it.</span><br></p>",
1.1 Sleep Environment,Moving Baby to their Own Room,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I’m a proud Red Nose Australia clinical ambassador - The Red Nose Foundation and the American Academy of Paediatrics recommend room sharing (not bed sharing) in their parents' room for the first 6-12 months of life.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This is to decrease the risk of sleep-related deaths often referred to as Sudden Unexplained Death of an Infant (SUDI) and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The benefits of room sharing:</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Room sharing is a protective measure, it allows you to respond rapidly to your baby. It has been shown to be positively associated with the establishment of breastfeeding.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Room sharing Vs bed sharing</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Room sharing and bed or surface sharing are very different.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>FAQs</strong></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q1: Do Babies Sleep Better in Their Own Room?</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:&nbsp;</strong><a rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"" href=""https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/140/1/e20170122/37986/Mother-Infant-Room-Sharing-and-Sleep-Outcomes-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext?autologincheck=redirected"">Research</a> has found that after 4 months of age, infants who room shared had more night waking and this resulted in less overnight sleep than those in their own rooms - so overall yes, they sleep better in their own room.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>There are a number of reasons for this:</em></span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q2: When should I move my baby into their own room?</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> There is no perfect time to move your baby to their own room. After the recommended minimum 6 months, each family needs to make this decision based on what’s right for them and their baby. The research mentioned above looking into room sharing disrupting sleep around 4 months is valid and the desire for uninterrupted sleep needs to be balanced with safety -</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em><strong>In this equation, safety will always trump.</strong></em></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>What the study did find was those facing interrupted sleep from room sharing at 4 months, two things arose:</em></span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q3: How to move a baby to their own room?</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’re doing this around 6 months, the transition to their own nursery or baby room is much easier and there will be minimal disruption. Younger babies will be less aware of the transition to a separate room and haven’t yet developed object permanence, which makes it easier to put them down and leave their bedroom. Parents are usually a lot more stressed by the move than the baby!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’re transitioning with an older baby, the steps below can help.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ensure their own room is <a rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"" href=""https://drgolly.com/red-nose-day-creating-safe-sleeping-environments/"">set up safely</a> and promotes healthy sleep both day and night.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 2:</strong> Watch wake windows and if following a routine, make sure it’s age-appropriate to help your baby sleep well in their own room.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 3:</strong> Have lots of playtime in their own bedroom before using the space for sleep. This is more important for older babies and toddlers, but it will help them see the room as a fun and positive space, not just for sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 4:</strong> Decide if you’re going to offer both day naps and night sleep in their own room or make it a gradual transition. To start with, you could move their bassinet or use a portacot and do day naps in the nursery for a few days while continuing room sharing overnight before moving all sleeps to their own room.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 5:</strong> At bedtime, make sure your baby has a relaxing wind-down routine, including some time in their bedroom. This might include a bottle or breastfeed before bed with a story and a cuddle before being placed into their sleeping bag or swaddle and put down to bed.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q4: Is it ok to offer naps and overnight sleep in different rooms?</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS</strong>: Yes! Many parents are worried this will confuse their baby, but this is usually not the case. It can be a nice transition to start with day naps in their own room while continuing room sharing overnight until you’re more comfortable with the transition.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Babies sleeping in multiple rooms isn’t always possible if you only have one cot; however, using a portacot is a good option.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q5: Do I Have to Use a Baby Monitor?</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> When you have moved your baby to their own room, using a baby monitor can provide an enormous amount of reassurance. There are many different types available, including breathing monitors, video monitors, and audio-only monitors.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Again, depending on where the room is and sleeping arrangements in your house, each family will need to decide which is right for them and their baby.

1.1 Sleep Environment,FAQs – Sleep Environment,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My toddler keeps undoing the zip on their sleep-suit/sleeping bag. How can I keep it on them to keep them warm overnight?</strong>ANS: Try putting the sleep suit/sleeping back on backwards so they can't reach the zip. Another option is to put a t-shirt on over the top to stop them taking the sleeping bag off.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My toddler is climbing out of the cot and we want to transition to a big bed for safety. Is this ok to do at this age?</strong><br>ANS: I recommend keeping your toddler in a cot until closer to 2.5-3 years old if possible. This is because they don't develop impulse control until closer to 2.5 years old, so don't understand how to physically stay in their bed all night. This often leads to lots of visits to their parents' bedroom overnight. If it's becoming a safety issue, try taking the base off the cot and putting the mattress on the floor (with the cot sides still assembled). This makes it taller and harder to climb out. Also try to keep them in a sleeping bag to a) keep them warm and b) make it harder to climb out of the cot.</span></p>",

1.2 Swaddling,Hip Health,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint that allows an incredible range of movements without much risk of dislocation (unlike the shoulder). The socket (pelvic bone, called the acetabulum) is very shallow, not holding the ball tightly. This is how all babies are born. The socket matures over time, and most babies develop a stable hip joint without any intervention.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>1 in 6 newborns have some hip instability – incorrect swaddling techniques can increase the risk of Hip Dysplasia.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">See the next section on the Dos and Don'ts for swaddling.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">What is Hip Dysplasia?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Hip dysplasia is a common condition that occurs when the ball and socket of the hip do not fit together in their normal position.

1.2 Swaddling,Swaddles That Can Impact Sleep,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Certain swaddle brands and swaddle methods can impact your baby's sleep, particularly swaddles that position your baby in an ""arms up"" position. While some babies are calmed by this method, it can encourage others to bring their hands to their mouth or brush the side of their face or cheek, which stimulates the rooting reflex.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A baby's <em>rooting reflex</em> is triggered when something brushes their mouth or cheek, causing them to turn their head in search of food. This can wake a baby from a light stage of sleep and make it difficult to resettle without offering milk.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If this sounds like your baby, we encourage you to try an arms across/arms down swaddle for a few days to see if it helps. You may need to persist for a few days until your baby gets used to the new swaddle.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Try not to give up too soon!</strong></span></p>",
1.2 Swaddling,Unswaddling,"<p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Swaddling helps turn on your baby’s calming reflex and protects them from the startle reflex, so un-swaddling too soon can cause an increase in sleep disturbances. There are no strict guidelines as to when you should unswaddle your baby, and many babies will wriggle free of their swaddle independently. All babies should be unswaddled by 6 months, or earlier if they have begun rolling from back to front. Once rolling, it makes it unsafe to continue swaddling them. 30% of babies are un-swaddled by 4 months, 50% by 6 months and 20% need to be un-swaddled in the 6th month for their safety.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tips on weaning from the swaddle:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">There are many transitional swaddles available that help make the process easier.

They’ll soon learn to resettle themselves in this position and it’s ok to sleep like this, as long as they got themselves into that position.

They shouldn’t interrupt the winding method.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">➡️ <strong>Do HICCOUGHS expel trapped air, do they count as a burp?</strong><br>ANS: Unfortunately, while it feels like there is a lot of air coming up, it doesn’t count as a burp—again, it just means you have to burp more.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">➡️ <strong>How do I avoid hiccoughs in the first place?</strong><br>ANS: No way at all, unfortunately. Babies are obligate nose breathers, so sometimes air just gets in. It doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong; it just means you have to help them get the air up.</span></p>",
1.3 Wind and Burping,FAQs – Winding/Burping,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. How do I manage burping when my baby is pulling off frequently?ANS:</strong> The most common reason a baby pulls off after a few short sucks is due to the gastro-colic reflex, as highlighted in the program. Trapped wind from the previous feed causes cramping in the colon as soon as the stomach starts to fill with milk from the current feed. While you may need to offer a quick burp each time they fall off the breast/bottle, it’s important to understand that your baby is telling us they needed to burp more at the previous feed. Hopefully, when they are fully winded at this feed, you’ll enter into a nice rhythm/cycle and see them sucking for longer periods of time at future feeds, so this becomes less of a problem.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Do I burp after each boob/bottle suck?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, it’s important to offer a burp after each side or break during a bottle feed. The goal is to get up as much wind as possible to prevent unsettledness in the coming hours. You don’t have to offer the full 15 minutes of winding after each small break, but at least offer the full 15 minutes at the end of the feed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. When are babies able to burp themselves and the winding process isn’t a thing anymore?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> This can last for many months, but babies slowly get better at winding themselves the longer they spend upright. Also, as they take larger volumes of solids, the need for winding subsides.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Is there a certain number of burps we should be aiming for in a feeding session?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> There's no magic number of burps as some are larger than others. That's why I like to devote a certain period of time to winding.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Do certain foods make breastfed babies more gassy?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> They certainly do! Things that make us gassy will also make babies gassy, like broccoli or beans. Babies also sometimes struggle with spice, garlic, or onion.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. We only get a maximum of 1-2 burps per 15 minutes. If this happens in the first 5-10 minutes, can we stop there or still need to continue for the full 15?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, always respond to your baby. If they bring up all their wind in the first five minutes, then there's no need to continue winding for another ten minutes.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. How important is the 2 minutes down, 1 minute up?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Similar to the question above, always respond to your baby. If you are achieving great burps with, say, 1 minute down and 30 seconds up, and your baby is showing no signs of discomfort from trapped wind, then that’s great. If you’re struggling to get burps up, then the 2 minutes down, 1 minute up for 15 minutes is really important.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Should the burp sound be loud &amp; obvious?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Your baby’s burps can be loud like Homer Simpson or a small whimper. All are bringing up air but definitely not the same amount. It’s important to wind thoroughly using the active winding technique and to always try to read your baby for signs of trapped wind. Remember, these may not be immediate, and you’ll often see the associated unsettledness in the hours to come.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Is a little spew/spit-up classed as a “burp”?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, sometimes a big bubble of gas can carry a small posset above it. This is no problem (other than the mess!).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. The active winding method requires baby to be horizontal, but my baby squirms and cries when horizontal after a feed, then when picked up has vomited. Is there an alternative to having the baby lay fully flat horizontal?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> You can keep your baby upright for a few minutes before beginning the method. When flat, try cycling the legs, rubbing the tummy, interacting playfully, or using a dummy to try to get them as calm as possible. Remember, small possets don't matter as long as the baby is gaining good weight.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. My baby is so hard to burp. I'm lucky to get one in 15 minutes. It's making night wakings so much longer, and I'm exhausted. Any advice?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Some babies are certainly harder to wind than others. If your active winding technique is right and you're devoting time to it after <strong>every feed</strong> but still not getting more burps after a week, consider adding a colic mix to help the wind out more easily.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. What colic mix do you recommend?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> As a paediatrician, I remain brand-agnostic when it comes to medicines, homeopathics, and listed pharmaceuticals. There are a number of different products on the market, including simethicone, dicyclomine, belladonna, hyoscyamine, and dozens more. It’s important to discuss these with your child’s doctor or paediatrician before administering any due to potential side effects.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Can nipple shields increase the amount of air my baby swallows and make them more uncomfortable?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> No, if your baby is attaching correctly around the shield, this should not be any different from a bottle or a breastfed baby. That is, they will all take in some air, and burping them after every sucking period is essential. I always recommend hand-expressing some milk into the top of the shield so that the first mouthful is milk, not air.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Can I burp a sleeping baby?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> I’m so glad you asked – the answer is YES! Many parents, particularly in the first 6 weeks, find their baby is showing tired signs before they have finished their active winding periods, and they know there are still a burp or two more to get up. My advice here is to swaddle them up, get them into the cot lying flat, and if they are dozy or fully asleep, you can still pick them up gently after a couple of minutes and get that last burp out. I often did the late-night 10/11 pm feed. I’d put them down, go clean my teeth, and then come back to get that last burp—it’s so satisfying!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Is the cot mattress too soft to use the active winding technique?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> For the full active winding method, the cot mattress isn’t ideal. But if it’s just for the last burp as your baby drifts off to sleep, then it’s absolutely fine.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Why do I have to lay my baby down on a hard surface during the Active Winding technique?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Laying your baby on a hard surface (e.g., carpeted floor, firm change mat) will help your baby's back muscles relax, which in turn allows their abdominal muscles to relax, encouraging wind to come up.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. My baby is very upset during the 2 minutes down on the mat. Is it okay to use a dummy/pacifier to help soothe them during this time?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, it is okay to use a dummy during the 2 minutes of horizontal time while winding to help keep your baby calm. However, remove the dummy before bringing them up to the vertical position. Every few days, try without the dummy during winding to see how your baby goes.</span></p>",
1.4 Tired Signs,Recognising Tired Signs,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tired signs vary from baby to baby, and it’s very normal to still be getting to know and recognize your baby’s tired signs at this age. You will generally start to see them towards the end of the suggested awake time. Rather than strictly watching the clock, watch your baby closely for any of these signs, and once observed, begin soothing your baby and put them down for a nap. This is the optimal time for a baby to fall asleep and will prevent them from becoming overtired.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p><br></p><table><tbody><tr><td><div><strong>I'm Getting Tired</strong><br></div></td><td><div><strong>I'm Ready for Bed</strong></div></td><td><div><strong>I'm Overtired</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Distant looks/stares<br></div></td><td><div>Yawning</div></td><td><div>Hysterical Crying</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Appearing bored</div></td><td><div>Eye rubbing</div></td><td><div>Arching back</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>More vocal/chatting</div></td><td><div>Pulling hair/ears</div></td><td><div>Stiff body</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Red eyebrows/eyelids</div></td><td><div>Wanting to suck and appearing</div><div>hungry</div></td><td><div>Very difficult to settle</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Starts posseting/spilling milk more</div><div>despite not being fed for some time</div></td><td><div>Making fists with hand</div><div><br></div></td><td><div><br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Jerky movements</div></td><td><div>Grizzling</div></td><td><div>​<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
1.5 Awake Times,A General Guide to Awake Times,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">​<br></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Babies' awake times slowly increase with age. However, at any particular age, one baby might only be able to cope with 1.5 hours of awake time, while another might manage 1 hour and 45 minutes—it’s quite variable. This is why it’s so important to not just watch the clock but also observe your baby and look for those <strong>all-important tired signs.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Note:</strong> If your baby only had a short cat nap, they likely won’t be able to stay awake as long as they would after a restorative 1.5–2 hour nap. Below are general guidelines for when your baby might begin to show tired signs. Once they do, it’s essential to get them down to sleep within 10–15 minutes to avoid overtiredness.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><div><u><strong>AGE</strong></u></div></td><td><div><u><strong>A GENERAL GUIDE TO AWAKE TIMES</strong></u></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>3-4 Weeks</div></td><td><div>1 Hour</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>6 Weeks</div></td><td><div>1 Hour 15 Minutes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>9 Weeks</div></td><td><div>1 Hour 30 Minutes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>12 Weeks</div></td><td><div>1 Hour 45 Minutes</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>16 Weeks</div></td><td><div>2 Hours</div></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is waking after one sleep cycle (40–45 minutes), it might be time to extend their awake time slightly.</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This doesn’t mean adding a full 30 minutes at once—start with an extra 5–15 minutes and see how they respond.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A wake-up after only <strong>20 minutes</strong> into a nap is often a sign of overtiredness. If this happens, try shortening their awake time slightly.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP:</strong> In the 1.6 routine lesson, you'll notice that the suggested awake times don’t always align exactly with nap times. This is because awake times are just a guide.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For example, if your <strong>6-week-old</strong> wakes at 7 AM and shows tired signs after <strong>1 hour 15 minutes</strong>, start the wind-down routine:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Take them to their sleep space</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Brief wind-down (e.g., nappy change, swaddle, turn off lights, white noise on)</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Gentle rocking/cuddling until drowsy</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Put them down</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This process may take <strong>5–10 minutes</strong>, bringing their total awake time to <strong>1 hour 20–25 minutes</strong>, which is closer to the suggested <strong>8:30 AM nap time</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Always remember to <strong>watch your baby, not the clock</strong>—if they need to nap <strong>10–15 minutes earlier or later</strong>, that’s completely fine!</span></p>",
1.5 Awake Times,Managing Overtiredness,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Overtiredness in Pre-schoolers 2-5 years old is really common, particularly when they first start to drop their day nap. Here are some overall tips for managing overtiredness with this age group.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Dropping the day nap:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">When they first start to drop their day nap, consider a day nap every second or third day to start with. It doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing approach.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Ensure some quiet rest time on no nap days, and an earlier bedtime.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Ideas for quiet time include watching some television (educational), colouring or drawing, reading books, etc.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Bedtime battles:</strong><br>Toddlers will often start wanting some control and independence over their day, including bedtime. Follow our CALM technique to help bedtime remain calm for everyone.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Attending childcare or starting kindergarten:</strong><br>Their days will be busy and exciting, both physically and emotionally. Stretching out their bedtime is the worst thing you can do. On kinder or childcare days, bring bedtime earlier if your preschooler is tired and cranky, or hasn’t slept as well as they usually would in the home environment.</span></p>",
1.5 Awake Times,Tips for Keeping Your Baby Awake During Feeds,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Is your baby falling asleep while feeding?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">While it is very normal, it can also be frustrating and difficult to keep your baby awake during a feed in those first few weeks of life. Often, they’re so comfortable, warm, and tired from feeding that falling asleep is inevitable.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>To help keep your newborn awake during a feed:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Strip your baby down to just their nappy and do skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate the natural instinct to find the breast and feed.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Stimulate your baby gently during the feed by <strong>tickling their feet, stroking their back, or blowing on their face</strong>.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Keep a <strong>damp, cool face-washer</strong> next to you and gently dab your baby’s forehead if they begin to fall asleep.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Compress your breasts</strong> to help stimulate the flow of milk when it has slowed down, preventing your baby from getting too sleepy.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Watch your baby for <strong>early feeding cues</strong> and feed before they exhibit late cues (distressed crying), as they may be too exhausted to sustain a long feed.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Offer a burp</strong>—trapped air can make your baby think they are full, so relieving this can allow them to feed longer.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Change feeding positions</strong> to help wake them up if they start getting sleepy.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">During the day, <strong>feed in a brightly lit room</strong>, and don’t hesitate to turn on the TV or play some music.</li></ul>",
1.5 Awake Times,Tips for Stretching Your Baby’s Awake Times,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Stretching your baby's wake windows can be difficult, and sometimes no matter what you try, they just won’t be able to keep their little eyes open. The best way to stretch their wake window is to do it <strong>gradually, by adding just 10 minutes to each awake period every few days.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The last awake period of the day may not be able to be stretched, and this can be normal. Babies will be at their most tired towards the end of the day, just like adults, and the worst thing to do here is stretch them too much and create overtiredness before bedtime. Our awake times in this program are just a guide—remember that every baby is different, and your baby might cope well with slightly shorter or longer awake times than what is recommended.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tips to help extend your baby's awake times:</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Face-to-face time with a song or nursery rhyme.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Playtime in a different room—if your baby has been playing in one room, taking them to a different room for the last little bit of their awake time can distract them with a change of scenery.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Taking them outside in the fresh air to look at the trees and environment around them—a burst of sunshine before a nap also helps with melatonin production!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 4:</strong> A brief walk in the pram—be careful your baby doesn’t fall asleep here if you’re wanting them to stay awake and go to sleep in their cot/bassinet. The morning nap and the third nap of the day are great ones to have while out and about.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 5:</strong> Offering a small top-up feed before their nap.</span></p>",
1.5 Awake Times,FAQs – Awake Times,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby can only last a short awake time (not the program's recommended awake time). Is this okay?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> Every baby is different, so if your baby is only managing shorter awake times but sleeping well and there are no issues, then there is no problem. However, if your baby is catnapping and very difficult to resettle after one sleep cycle of 40-45 minutes, then this is a sign to try to stretch them a little more and increase their sleep debt. This will help them go back to sleep and transition through sleep cycles without waking fully. You don’t have to stretch them to the recommended times all in one day—simply try extending their awake time by 5-10 minutes every couple of days.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby is only having around 1 hour 15 minutes - 1 hour 45 minutes of awake time, but the routine suggests stretching awake time between the last nap and bedtime to 2 hours 15 minutes. Is this correct?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> We don’t recommend stretching your baby if they can’t yet make this awake time, and the times in the routines are a rough guide. To help keep the early evening on track, you could offer a 1-hour late afternoon nap until 5 pm and then bring bedtime earlier as needed. It’s never a good idea to stretch your baby too much and make them overtired, especially at the end of the day. Remember to watch your baby, not just the clock. As your baby gets closer to 12 weeks old, having a longer awake time will be easier, but they still may not reach those exact times suggested in the routine.</span></p>",
1.6 Routine,Routine Intro,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Babies thrive on routine, and most parents find it helpful too, knowing how their day will look and when they can schedule appointments or catch up with friends, etc.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Having your baby on an age-appropriate routine is the key to them learning to link their sleep cycles and settle well at sleep time. Routines are not only helpful for parents, but babies thrive when they are settled into a predictable, developmentally-appropriate routine. This minimises the risk of babies becoming overtired, too hungry to feed properly, and stressed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The routines below are intended to be used as a guide, as some babies will require more or less sleep than the hours described.</span></p>",

1.6 Routine,Dropping Night Feeds,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Toddlers and Night Feeding</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By this age I expect toddlers 1-2 years of age to be sleeping a full 12 hours through the night 7pm to 7am, and your toddler should be eating 3 meals and a couple of snacks during the day, with milk turning into the supplementary not primary source of nutrition. Toddlers shouldn't be waking overnight from hunger, and milk overnight at this age can lead to less hunger during the day which subsequently causes a negative cycle of feeding overnight. My general guidelines for dropping night feeds are in the Dropping Night Feeds video, much of this process is to do with nutrition and consolidating feeds to the daytime.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>For many of you, this may not be as relevant and your toddler could be feeding habitually for comfort. If your toddler is feeding for comfort then it's perfectly ok to drop any night feeds cold turkey and resettle them when they wake overnight using your settling technique (see the next section).</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>TIP:</em></strong> Often the non-breastfeeding parent (if still breastfeeding) is best to do the resettling overnight.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><h4 style=""line-height: 1;text-align: left""><span style=""color: rgb(139, 195, 195);font-size: 16px""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><strong>It can take a couple of tough nights to adjust:</strong></span></span></h4><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dropping night feeds isn't as daunting as it sounds. As you'll see in the video, there are gradual ways to do this, however at this age dropping them cold turkey is also perfectly fine as long as your toddler is eating and drinking well during the day.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It might well be a couple of tough nights until your toddler adjusts to the&nbsp;<strong><em>new normal&nbsp;</em></strong>and learns to sleep through without a feed, but you can be reassured in the fact that your toddler isn't waking from hunger and that they are simply protesting because you're not responding as they are used to.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>TIP: &nbsp;</em></strong><em>It can be helpful to let your workplace know that you might be a little more tired for a couple of days and explain what you're doing.</em></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A solid night's sleep for all will begin to be the new normal and will be worth the effort!</span></p>",
1.6 Routine,Roll-Over and Dream Feeds,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>NOTE: Both roll-over and dream feeds should only be used until 7 months as per the routine.</strong></span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">What is a roll-over feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A roll-over feed is suitable for late evening feeds (they work really well for some, not all babies). They involve gently waking your baby, but keeping stimulation to a minimum, like ‘rolling’ one sleep into the next. Lights are kept dim, and there are minimal interactions. While a roll-over feed is likely to be smaller than a full daytime feed, it is far more filling than a dream feed.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">What is a dream feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A dream feed is a feed where your baby stays asleep or is aroused to a lighter stage of sleep.<br><em>These are suitable for babies over 6 weeks old.</em> You may choose to keep the stimulation to a minimum or try to maintain sleep throughout.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Roll-over Vs dream feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Both are reasonable options - your baby will tell you which they prefer.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">How do I offer a dream feed?</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This feed can be offered by both breast and bottle, and if you’re wanting to introduce a bottle into your baby’s routine, this is the perfect time to add it (I recommend this after 4-6 weeks when breastmilk supply has been established).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gently pick up your sleeping baby out of the bassinet or crib.<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Keep your baby swaddled or in their sleeping bag.<br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Position yourself comfortably as you would for any regular feed.<br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Gently tease your baby’s mouth with the nipple or bottle teat until they open enough to latch.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If it’s difficult, try stroking their cheek or lips to stimulate their rooting reflex and encourage them to take the nipple.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 5:</strong> Give your baby a bottle or breastfeed.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Some babies will only take one side of the breast or a smaller amount than they usually would in a bottle compared to a regular feed, and this is normal.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 6:</strong> Make sure your baby is well winded.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Even though it’s a quick feed, it’s important not to miss this. This will help stop them waking in the middle of the night from trapped wind and be likely to sleep longer. You can absolutely burp them while they are asleep/half asleep.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 7:</strong> After a quick cuddle, put your drowsy baby back to sleep in their crib or bassinet.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds don’t work for every baby. Some will wake too much and be difficult to resettle, while others just refuse to feed while still asleep. I recommend continuing to try a dream feed for at least one week, as it can take this long for it to be successful. Dads can offer the dream feed with a bottle while mum goes to bed earlier for the night.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds are often much smaller and less satisfying than feeding when awake—and may not give them the calories they need to sleep through until 7am reliably. However, if your baby is sleeping through till morning with a dream feed, there is nothing you need to change!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds should not be offered past 7 months old. Disturbing their night sleep at this age can be counterproductive and actually increase night waking, so after 7 months, let your baby wake on their own for a feed overnight if needed.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tips for a successful roll-over or dream feed</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Keep the lights dim and stimulation to a minimum—try to use a hallway light or a small nightlight to help stop your baby waking fully.<br><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Only change their nappy if it is heavy or soiled. If necessary, change the nappy before the feed and only unswaddle their bottom half to try and keep them as drowsy and settled as possible.<br><strong>Tip 3:</strong> If offering a bottle, have it all ready to go so you don't have to leave the room to prepare it.<br><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Leave the white noise playing to help keep your baby calm and quiet.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">FAQs on the Late Night Feed</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q:</strong><em>My baby is going down at 7pm and sleeps to 3-4am. I'm hesitant to wake them for the 10pm/11pm roll-over/dream feed. Do I still need to wake them?</em><br><strong>A:</strong> YES, absolutely. The reason I recommend this late evening feed is because we are aiming to consolidate the nice long stretch overnight and get your baby sleeping as close to 7am as possible. The 3-4am feed is what we are aiming to drop first, followed by the 10/11pm evening feed (once solids are established).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q:</strong><em>How long should a dream feed be?</em><br><strong>A:</strong> Let your baby feed for as long as they want to here. It might be 5 to 15 minutes at the breast, or 60-120ml in a bottle. As mentioned above, sometimes this feed isn't a full feeding because your baby is still drowsy or asleep, and this is fine.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q:</strong><em>Is breast or bottle feeding best here?</em><br><strong>A:</strong> Babies can be breastfed or bottle-fed with expressed milk or formula at this feed. It's a great feed to offer a bottle at, as it means mum can go to bed earlier and dad or the non-breastfeeding parent can still offer the feed—again taking into consideration that I don't recommend this until breastmilk supply has been established if you're breastfeeding.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q:</strong><em>How do I know if the dream feed is working for my baby?</em><br><strong>A:</strong> Dream feeds are supposed to help babies sleep for a longer stretch and be easier to put back down to bed. If this isn't happening and night wakings are continuing frequently despite trying for a week, then it might be best to let your baby wake on their own for a feed, or wake them and feed at 10/11pm instead.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dream feeds are fantastic, but in my experience, they don't work for all babies, and this is okay.</span></p><p><br></p>",
1.6 Routine,Early Morning Waking,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Please see our lessons on early morning waking in Chapter 1.3 - Routines.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Below is a contingency plan of what to do if your baby wakes early.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Under 5 months old</strong><br>Power nap: If your baby has woken early (i.e., pre 6.15 am) and will not resettle, then a power nap can be used until 5 months old. A power nap is a small 15-minute nap ONLY to help get your baby through to their next nap time and keep their day on track. Allowing them to only have 15 minutes may seem cruel, but we want to avoid them falling into a very deep sleep, as this will decrease their drive to sleep, making their next nap harder to achieve.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">So your morning might look something like this:<br>6 am - Wake up, unable to be resettled<br>7.15 am - Power nap<br>7.30 am - Wake baby up<br>9 am - Nap 1 back on track.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A power nap is only a temporary solution and should only be used for a few days in a row, as we don’t want it to become a new habit.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Over 5 months old:</strong><br>If your baby wakes early, try your best to stretch them out until as close to their normal nap time as possible. A little walk around the garden or playtime in a different room might help pass the time if they are more fussy and tired than usual because of the early wake-up.</span></p>",
1.6 Routine,Early Morning Waking Tips & FAQs,"<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Double check why your baby might be waking - and think of hunger as the last option.</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Could they be overtired or under-tired from the previous day's sleep?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Double check the age bracket your baby is in and if their day sleep matches what's in their age-appropriate routine. It can be tempting to let them take extra long naps and have some bonus time to yourself - but most likely this will bite you in the bottom overnight.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Don't forget to cap their morning nap at what is age-appropriate. Ie. 45 mins at 6 months, 30 mins by 8 months. Remember, too much sleep at the first nap can encourage early morning waking.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Consider dropping them to 2 naps if they are consistently waking early despite eliminating all other reasons.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Are they too cold?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">In my experience, this is the most common reason a baby wakes around 4am (the coldest part of the night) - double-check what TOG they are wearing and the temperature of the room. If it's not 18-21°C think about a heater option.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Are they too hot?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This is less common but still something to think about.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Is the morning light coming in and waking them up?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This is a HUGE one, if you haven’t invested in blackout blinds and your baby is waking as the sun comes up, this is probably the reason.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Could it be wind?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">See my content on Colic and wind signs to dive further into this. Most of the time due to it being the middle of the night we don’t wind as effectively or for as long for evening or night feeds - this can lead to wind and may make them very uncomfortable in the early hours.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Is it a dirty nappy?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">It seems obvious but have a smell - if there’s a poo you need to change it, I’m yet to meet a baby that will sleep comfortably with a soiled nappy. Most babies will handle a slightly wet nappy but if it’s super full (if they are cold and have been having lots of overnight feeds it probably is) you will need to change this too. Keep the lights low or off and just use the torch on your phone - calm and dark for overnight changes is the key.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Do they have eczema that could be bothering them?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Like colic, if they are uncomfortable it will be impossible to get them to sleep - work with your doctor to get on top of any eczema.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>And lastly, Are they hungry?</strong><br>The reason why we look at hunger last is if a baby is fed as soon as they wake before 7am, they take in calories, which means they won't be as hungry or have as full of a feed in the morning …and the cycle of too many calories overnight and not enough during the day continues - this is often referred to as <em>reverse cycling.</em> Revisit the video on dropping night feeds for more on this.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is hungry in the early hours of the morning and showing signs of readiness for solids then it's an ideal time to start introducing these.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For babies over 6 months old, ensure they're having 25-50g of a protein source at their lunchtime solids. This will help stabilize their blood sugars overnight, help them feel fuller, and encourage them to sleep through the night.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>For all early morning waking, keep the lights preferably off or as down low as possible and limit all interaction:</strong> this isn't the time to sing songs and chat to them as we want to try and keep them as sleepy as possible - the less stimulation the better.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Remember that early morning waking is <em>the</em> hardest thing to fix when it comes to infant sleep.</strong> It can take 3-4 weeks of consistency to see improvements. If your baby starts waking at 6am instead of 5.45am this is a small change, but each small change should be taken as a big win!</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Early Morning Waking FAQs</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. What should I do if my baby wakes before 6am?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Go through the above checklist and rule out common reasons for waking. Try to resettle your baby using your chosen settling technique (chapter 1.8 - settling and calming babies). If you feel your baby is hungry then feed as needed, but aim to start decreasing this overnight feed. Please refer back to the Dropping Night Feeds video in this lesson.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. What should I do if my baby wakes around 6am and won't resettle?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> For babies under 5 months old, try to resettle them but if they don't go back to sleep, use a power nap to help keep the day on track (see more info in the 'Power Naps for Babies Under 5 Months Old' lesson further along in this chapter).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For babies over 5 months old, always try and resettle them until closer to 6.30/7am. If they won't resettle then try to stretch them as close to their first nap time as possible. Try your best to get them close to 9am, as offering a morning nap earlier than this can just encourage the early morning waking.</span></p>",
1.6 Routine,Power Naps for Early Morning Waking/Cat-Nappers,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A power nap is a brief 15-minute nap that helps get your baby through to the next nap time. They're used when your baby has woken early from a nap and not been able to resettle, or if they've woken early in the morning and not resettled back to sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">These are useful from <strong>12 weeks old - 5 months old.</strong> They are a temporary solution and shouldn’t be used for weeks on end, but are very useful in the short term to help encourage them to adjust to a new routine and keep their day on track.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s very important to <strong>wake your baby after 15 minutes</strong> to stop them from falling into a deep sleep, as otherwise, this will throw off their next nap. Power naps are fine to be assisted naps, so in the car seat, pram, or carrier is perfectly ok.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">How you might use a power nap is outlined below, but obviously, the timing will differ for babies depending on their age:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Early morning waking</em></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">6:00 am - Baby woke and wouldn't resettle</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">7:30 am - Power nap</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">7:45 am - Woken from power nap</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">8:30 am - Morning nap</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Cat nap</em></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">9:00 am - Baby down for a nap</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">9:40 am - Woke up and unable to be resettled</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">11:00 am - Power nap in pram</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">11:15 am - Woken from power nap</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">12:00/12:15 pm - Down for next nap</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Your main priority at this age is to avoid overtiredness but still try and teach your baby to consolidate their naps.</strong></span></p>",
1.6 Routine,False Starts,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Does your baby go to bed in the evening and then wake after 30-45 mins?</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s like they’re treating bedtime as a nap and seem completely awake after 1 sleep cycle – these are called <strong><em>false starts</em></strong>. False starts happen for a few different reasons and they can be incredibly frustrating for parents, when you think you’ve finally got your baby down for the night.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>THE MAIN CAUSES OF FALSE STARTS ARE:</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Over-tiredness</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">When your baby is overtired, they go to bed at night with a high level of circulating cortisol, our stress hormone.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This makes it harder for them to connect sleep cycles and will often wake before going into a deep sleep and will often wake crying and inconsolable.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Under-tiredness</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This is when your baby has possibly had too much sleep during the day, or napped too close to bedtime and simply doesn’t have enough sleep pressure (or sleep debt) built up.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Try extending their awake time and ensure you’re following an age appropriate routine.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Unable to link sleep cycles yet</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">At this young age it's very normal for your baby to not link their sleep cycles yet, and they may need some assistance from you to help get them back to sleep.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Settling techniques like shush-pat, or being rocked, held, or a dummy being replaced.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Some babies won't learn to link sleep cycles until closer to 4-5 months.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Focus on creating an ideal sleep environment, eliminating hurdles, and sticking to an appropriate wake window/routine.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Inappropriate daytime routine</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Babies thrive on routine and if they are in a routine that includes too much day sleep, or not enough day sleep, then they’re more likely to experience false starts at bedtime.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s a good idea to review your baby’s nap times and alter them if you think it could be contributing to overnight sleep.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Sleep environment</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This is particularly important during those months and locations that have daylight savings time.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Make sure your baby’s bedroom is blacked out as much as possible, as too much light coming in can encourage them to wake after 1 sleep cycle before the sun goes down for the day.</li></ul>",
1.6 Routine,Routines On-The-Run,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The recommended routines will give you a guide as to how your day will look, however, we appreciate that you will still need to get out of the house and sometimes it will be during suggested nap times. It's important to note that after around 6 months of age, sleep on the go (in the pram/carrier/car seat) is usually less restorative and your baby will be more likely to wake after one sleep cycle and be difficult to get back to sleep. Because of this, the naps we suggest you offer while out and about are the <strong>first-morning nap</strong> and the <strong>third late afternoon nap</strong> (if your baby hasn't dropped it yet). These naps are great to offer on the go as we are not so focused on their length and it is generally ok if they have a shorter nap at these times. The third late afternoon nap is a tricky one to achieve as your baby reaches 7-8 months so this nap is perfectly fine to have anywhere, in fact, it is usually easier to get babies to have a brief nap in the pram, car, or carrier at this time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>FOCUS: The nap we want to focus on being the longest and most restorative is the lunchtime nap.</em></strong> This is because it helps keep on top of over-tiredness and sets you up for a better night. It is also the nap your baby will be having until they are around 3 years old, so teaching them now to have a longer nap here helps in the long term. As much as you can, offer the lunchtime nap at home in their cot and focus on resettling your baby if they wake early.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">**﻿To help your baby sleep while out and about during the day, try to recreate their sleep environment as much as possible:**</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Darken the pram with a <em>breathable blackout cover</em>. Don't use a blanket as this doesn't usually provide enough darkness and the temperature in the pram can become dangerously high.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Use the same white noise or nature sounds</em> that you use at home. There are many portable white noise machines available that run on batteries.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is still swaddled and you want to encourage them to nap in the pram, <em>use the same swaddle</em> you do at home.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you do have to head out during your baby's lunchtime nap then on occasion it is ok to offer a longer morning nap and then 2 shorter naps later in the day, but just try not to make this a regular pattern. You might also notice your baby is more tired at bedtime so don't stretch them out, bring bedtime earlier.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">**﻿If you are going out for dinner occasionally we recommend the following changes:**</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you are heading out to a restaurant then giving your baby a slightly longer 3rd nap (or a brief catnap if they have already dropped this nap) will allow you to push bedtime out a bit. If your baby falls asleep in the car on the way home then attempt to transfer them to their cot, however, if they wake up this is ok. Offer a small top-up feed and pop them to bed.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you are visiting family or friends and have access to a porta cot then treat your baby's bedtime the same as you usually would (minus the bath if this is too difficult). Try to recreate their usual sleep environment as much as possible. Make sure the room is as dark as possible, use your white noise/nature sounds, use the same swaddle or fitted cot sheet so it smells like home, and bring any comforters/dummies your baby uses at sleep time.</li></ul><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/67b/ced/441/shutterstock_1686532744.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1686532744.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" origin-size=""5040,3360"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>",

1.6 Routine,FAQs – Routine,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My child needs to drop their nap but how do I stop them from becoming so tired and cranky by the afternoon?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: It’s normal during any nap transition for there to be an adjustment period and some increased tiredness. With tiredness of course comes cranky and grumpy kids, but if their night sleep is being affected then I still recommend dropping the day nap. Try your best to push them through but after lunch make sure they do have some quiet time. This might be reading stories, doing some quiet drawing or building blocks or even watching a movie. If they are super tired and cranky by dinnertime then bring their evening routine forward. Try dinner at 4.45pm, bath at 5.15pm and bedtime by 6/6.15pm. Push through for a few days and they will quickly adjust to their new routine and be sleeping more soundly at night.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My child is fighting bed-time in the evening. How do I get them to go to sleep earlier?</strong><br>ANS: If your child is fighting going to bed this is a sign that they are ready to either have their day nap capped back or dropped completely. If they still have a nap of 1hr+ then start capping it back to as little as 30-40mins with a bedtime of 7pm. If bedtime is still an issue with a reduced nap time then drop it completely and bring bedtime a little earlier until they adjust through the transition. Some sleep training may also need to happen if the bedtime battles have been going on for a while. Please see our settling techniques and choose one you feel will suit your child and family and also one you can stay consistent with.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I have to work and can’t get my child into bed early with childcare pick up/dinner/bath routine. How do I go about this?</strong><br>ANS: You just have to do your best here! Sometimes life throws us crazy days and we can’t always get our children into bed when we’d like to. However on the days you can I recommend aiming for a bedtime as per my routine as a well-rested child is one that will cope better when the schedule is thrown off sometime.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: We follow your routine but my child is now crying at bedtime for 20-30mins and taking longer to go to sleep. Is this normal and what can we do to fix it?</strong><br>ANS: As your child gets older they are better at coping with a longer awake time between the end of their lunchtime nap and bedtime. Usually, it is around 5 - 5.5 hours for a 2 - 3 year old if still having a day nap. If your child has recently started protesting more at bedtime and taking longer to fall asleep it is a sign to extend their awake time here, starting with 15 min increments. However, if they are waking late from their lunchtime nap (ie. around 3pm and needing a 5 - 5.5 hour awake time), the best option is to cut the nap back so they are having a shorter nap/waking earlier and then into bed for the night at an earlier, more age-appropriate time.</span></p>",

It's helpful from an early age to pop your baby down to sleep where they will wake up, such as a cot or bassinet. If your baby is over-tired, they will also tend to wake quickly after falling asleep, and this is because their body doesn't allow them to fall into a deep sleep after the 20-minute mark, instead waking up and often being difficult to resettle.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby is still waking up after 40-50 mins after trying your program for a few days. Is this normal?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Please keep in mind that some babies won’t learn to link their sleep cycles until closer to 4-5 months of age, and this is still developmentally normal. It can also take more than a few days of consistency and persistence to see improvements. I encourage you to hang in there and keep trying, and remember that tomorrow is a new day! If your baby wakes early, try resettling them as per the routine suggestions, but (as above) it’s also okay to continue the nap in the pram, car seat, carrier, or being held, as realistically not every nap will be perfect at this young age.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: The constant resettling is draining me - I don't know how much longer I can do it for.</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> If the 30-minute resettling is becoming too much for every sleep, don't be afraid to give yourself a break. Have a week off and then revisit again when you feel ready—you need to know what you can manage. Be kind to yourself, and if resettling every sleep every day is exhausting, then just try it a couple of times a week or for one sleep a day. <strong>If it wasn't clear—give yourself a break—you are amazing, and your baby is lucky to have a coach to help them learn this essential skill. You will absolutely get there.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I've been following everything you say, and my baby still isn't linking their sleep cycles - what do I do?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Sometimes, it’s just time that’s needed. While some babies will link these cycles from day one, for others, it’s important to remember that it’s developmentally normal for some babies not to be able to link these cycles until 4-5 months. <strong>If you're doing all the things above, sometimes the answer is just to trust the process.</strong></span></p>",

Many of the techniques used up to this age are still able to be used now, but most babies will prefer to be unswaddled and many will be moving freely around their cot, rolling independently, and be less responsive to traditional, newborn settling methods. By this age, it is important not to rock your baby to sleep. I will explain new techniques for settling that are age-appropriate and don’t involve any cry-it-out methods.

1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,Intro,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In this section, we'll discuss two types of sleep settling techniques.</span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Spaced Soothing</strong></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Room Retreat</strong></li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s important to pick a settling technique that you think will fit with your toddler’s temperament and also your parenting style. A toddler that is used to being fed or rocked to sleep will cope better with a gentler technique such as room retreat rather than spaced soothing.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Try to stick to one technique for at least a week, as changing techniques too often will just confuse your little one. <em><strong>Consistency, persistence, and patience are the keys when using any sleep training technique.</strong></em></span></p>",
1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,Intro,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There is high variability with routines for a 2-5-year-old. At this age your child should be having 1 nap until they are showing signs they are ready to drop it. Our program will teach you what to look for and signs that your child is ready to drop their nap.<br>Between 2-3 years old, keep their awake time to roughly 5 - 5.5 hours before and after their day nap. There is a lot more flexibility at this age range with nap times, but remember that the less sleep your child has at lunchtime, the earlier bedtime will need to be. Even just 10-15mins earlier can make a difference.<br>Between 3-4 years old, some children are still napping occasionally and if this is your child and it's not disrupting their overnight sleep then it's not a problem. Sometimes however, childcare providers will still be encouraging your child to have a nap because the other children in the room do, and for some children this is very disruptive to their night time routine and bedtime.<br>Between 4-5 years old children will be able to go without a nap but will still need some quiet time in the middle of the day. As they are approaching school age and most likely starting kindy or even prep, it's important to recognise that your child might need an earlier bedtime during any kinder/school transition. This is a big time physically, mentally, socially and emotionally and keeping on top of their sleep needs is so important.</span></p>",

There can start to be behavioural challenges for some children around food at this age and it’s important for parents to give consistent responses and approach to their child’s eating.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Ideally parents/an adult will always be eating with a child to model good eating behaviours and to continue to keep them interested in a broad range of different foods. Again it’s important that children have a variety of foods from each core food group.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Do not despair if your child starts to refuse certain foods. Although frustrating, this represents an important development of autonomy, where they seek to control more and more of their environment. At this age, the things they can usually control are their food intake and clothing choices.</span></p>",

1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,Is It OK To Rock Or Hold My Baby To Sleep?,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There is a very important, very fundamental rule about humans: the way we fall asleep is the way we expect to wake up. It may sound silly, but if you fell asleep in your bed tonight and woke in the middle of the night in the same place, you roll over, go back to sleep—and don’t remember. <em>But if you woke in another room</em>—you would startle awake and look to find out how/why things have changed. Babies are the same. If they fall asleep being rocked in their mother’s arms, then at the end of a sleep cycle, they will wonder where that parent is—and be unable to stitch together multiple cycles. While this can be a lovely way to help your baby fall asleep on occasion, it also isn't sustainable in the long term for most parents. Rocking a tiny baby at 4-5kg is very different from rocking an older baby at 10kg multiple times a day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Whenever possible, put your baby down sleepy, but awake.</strong> Many parents will report their baby only sleeping 45 minutes at a time—well, this is usually the reason. It’s what drives the inability to self-soothe and stitch together cycles.</span></p>",
1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,Settling Techniques,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Now that your baby is over 4 weeks old, we can begin using different techniques to help settle them to sleep. We are not insisting that they self-settle at this age though, as babies up to 12-16 weeks often still need parental reassurance and a lot of hands-on settling.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Remember:</strong><em>cry-it-out is not recommended and should always be avoided.</em> After all, they are still in the midst of the ‘fourth trimester’ until 12 weeks old.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Additional methods of settling - and resettling - babies:</span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Sleep cues like sleepy words</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Shush-pat technique</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Capped comforting</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">1. Introducing sleepy words to your baby:</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As part of any routine, even from this early age, both parents should find a phrase or some sleepy words that you can say to your baby as you put them down for sleep. It doesn’t have to be lengthy, but just a few words they will quickly begin to recognize as a sleep cue.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Something like “night night, it’s sleep time now, I love you” or “it’s sleepy time now, sweet dreams.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Say your sleepy words right as you pop your baby in their bassinet/cot for a sleep and repeat them once or twice before leaving them to fall asleep. If you need to resettle your baby, then repeat your sleepy words during the resettling process.</span></p><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">2. Shush-pat settling technique:</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The shush-pat technique is useful for babies up to 4 months.</span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Make sure the baby is showing tired signs and start the nap time ritual.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Swaddle baby.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Shush baby and rock gently in your arms for a couple of minutes.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Place baby into the bassinet/cot.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Turn baby onto their side, supporting both tummy and back with each of your hands.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Continue shushing. The volume of your voice (or white noise) must match the volume of your baby’s cries if upset.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Gently pat baby in the middle of the back or on their bottom. Keep the patting at the pace of a normal heartbeat (about 60 beats per minute).</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">As baby is calmed, continue the shush-pat but slow the patting down. Continue shushing or white noise. This can take up to 20 minutes, as this is how long it takes for a baby to fall into a deep sleep state. Sometimes babies will calm but keep their eyes open. Gently stroking their nose in a downwards movement (from forehead to tip of the nose) can encourage them to close their eyes.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">DON’T STOP TOO SOON!</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Once the baby is asleep, gently roll them onto their back.</li></ol><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">3. Capped Comforting:</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This is a great technique for younger babies who don’t respond well to the initial hands-on shush-pat settling technique. Every baby has a different temperament, and while some babies LOVE hands-on settling, others are less interested.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once put to bed, and troubleshooting is complete, give them a short period of time to try and wind down themselves, but if still upset after a few minutes, then enter their room and repeat your sleep words and comfort them as needed with examples below, trying to avoid feeding.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is well-fed and showing tired signs but struggling to fall asleep, or waking shortly thereafter, begin by troubleshooting simple measures like a nappy change, temperature check, or expelling any remaining burps.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Capped comforting might look something like this:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Wrap baby in a muslin wrap with arms (not legs) swaddled firmly.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Cuddle for no more than 10 minutes until soothed, put to bed awake and without a pacifier.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Leave baby for 5 minutes, even if crying.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If awake but not screaming, try having them suck on a clean finger or pacifier.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If crying is escalating, pick up and soothe again.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Cuddle until no longer screaming, then re-settle and put to bed again.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If still awake, use the shush-pat technique to help them off to sleep.</li></ul>",

1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,General Thoughts On Pacifiers/Dummies,"<p><strong>Pacifiers or dummies are a very useful settling tool for newborns.</strong></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>First:</strong> If your baby enjoys sucking on a dummy or a thumb, it's completely normal. Up to 90% of infants find it incredibly settling. Babies are born with an innate sucking reflex, and allowing them to suck helps activate their calming reflex.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As a paediatrician, people expect me to have a militant view on dummies, but I don't. It's like my general parenting philosophy—it's what works for you and your baby.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Below are some Pros &amp; Cons of dummies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The only thing I strongly advise is that they are removed or heavily reduced by the age of two to prevent dental problems (see below for details).</strong></span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>PROS of dummies:</strong></span></h3><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Dummies are a great settling tool. For unsettled babies, I highly recommend their use briefly during the winding process if they are squirming and uncomfortable on their backs.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Unlike the thumb, they can be removed (see below).</li></ol><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>CONS of dummies:</strong></span></h3><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Sleep disruption for you and your baby:</strong> Sometimes pacifiers may help a baby fall asleep, but they can interfere with maintaining sleep. Parents often find themselves up countless times during the night replacing them (a baby won't learn to find it until about 7 months), or the baby frequently catnaps because the pacifier falls out of their mouth. In these circumstances, I recommend ditching it.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Dummies fall on the ground regularly and get grubby fingers on them.<br><em>Note:</em> Lots of parents clean a dummy by sucking on it, but it's best to run it under water as you're often just transferring oral bacteria from your own mouth to your baby.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Safety:</strong> Straps that pin them to sleep suits or outfits can be a strangulation risk.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>They can act as a crutch:</strong> This can prevent the identification of underlying problems and become another reason for overnight waking. If you are using the dummy 100% of the time to settle your baby, we may be missing something that is causing the discomfort.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Both thumb sucking and dummies can be associated with tooth decay.</li></ol><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Thumbs vs. Dummies:</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your child has a strong oral fixation, a dummy may be preferable to a thumb. The main reason a dummy is preferable over thumb sucking is that a dummy can be taken away to stop the habit (you can't hide a thumb in the cupboard!). Research confirms that a child that previously sucked on a dummy is highly unlikely to move to a thumb.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Thumb sucking can be much harder to prevent once the habit is ingrained. It is also less preferable as it can cause:<br>👍🏻 Sore thumbs<br>👍🏻 Infections<br>👍🏻 Calluses on the thumb</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP:</strong> Remove the dummy (and thumb sucking where possible) beyond the age of 2 to minimize dental problems.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Dental problems from excessive sucking of thumbs or dummies can include:<br>🦷 Excessive overjet<br>🦷 Buck teeth<br>🦷 Posterior crossbite</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Note: This is not alarmist—there are plenty of perfectly healthy and happy kids who had a dummy and sucked their thumb a bit. But if it’s excessive, you need to be aware of the possible impact.</em></span></p><hr><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Ditching the Dummy</strong></span></h2><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>When to ditch the pacifier?</em></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As discussed, babies can’t learn to find and replace their pacifier until around 7 months old, so that can mean a lot of broken sleep waiting for your baby to learn this skill. If your baby is under 4-5 months old, I recommend ditching it if it is negatively impacting their sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The good news is that if sleep has been thrown off track, then getting rid of a pacifier can only help things. Yours and your baby’s sleep shouldn’t be impacted too much more than it already is.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>How to ditch the dummy:</em></span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">When settling your baby for a nap and at bedtime, watch their awake times and tired signs and be sure to get them into bed within 10 minutes of showing these signs.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Timing is important for all sleeps, but especially when ditching the pacifier, as we don’t want to pop baby down too early (not enough sleepiness) or too late (overtiredness).</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Settle your baby with no dummy—place them in their cot/bassinet using your settling techniques.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is still awake and upset 10 minutes later, then go and help them to sleep with a pat/cuddle/rock/etc.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">In the first few days, if you need to resettle your baby (e.g., if they wake early from a nap), try your best to help them back to sleep, but offer the dummy only if all else fails. We want to ensure we keep on top of sleep and don’t have a baby that is too overtired.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">After the first few days, ditch the dummy altogether, as the baby should be getting used to settling without it.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you have successfully ditched the dummy, there is nothing to say you can’t give it back to them if needed when they are older and can learn to find and replace it themselves.</li></ul><hr><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>FAQs on Dummies:</strong></span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. Will sucking on a dummy worsen wind problems? Will my baby swallow more air when they use a dummy?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Sucking on a dummy does not increase aerophagia (swallowing excess air).</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/8f9/d30/5d5/Dr_Golly_Templates_%285%29.png"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size=""408px,408px"" data-align=""none"" data-file-name=""Dr_Golly_Templates_%285%29.png"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""width: 408px; height: 408px;""></figure></div>",

1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,A Note On Crying,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Regardless of which settling technique is chosen, there is bound to be some crying as the baby adjusts. It’s important to remember that this is not because your baby feels abandoned or unloved, but rather because your baby is tired or perhaps frustrated that expected reactions are not taking place. Babies will often protest at the changes we are making to help them learn to sleep more soundly.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I would never expect you to leave your baby or child to ‘cry it out’ and, in fact, I would never recommend others do something that I couldn’t do with my own children. This program is about tuning in to your parental instinct, listening to your baby, and choosing a technique that you can be consistent with. I want to show you what your baby is capable of (it’s often far more than we think!) and the best methods to achieve this.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">With the settling techniques recommended, make sure you choose one that is achievable for your family! Every parent and family is different, but both caregivers should be on the same page to give your baby the same, consistent message.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A question we regularly get on crying:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q. I’ve been implementing your program, but my baby still cries whenever I put him/her down to sleep. How long until they stop this?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> It takes all babies a different amount of time to stop crying at bedtime. Some seem to never do it, while others take a couple of weeks to adjust. Some babies also still have a grizzle or chat, and that becomes their way to wind down—just like when we go to sleep, most of us don’t fall asleep the second our head hits the pillow.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I recommend lots of playtime in their room during the day so they see it as a positive, happy place to be. If they start crying when you enter the bedroom to put on a sleeping bag, try doing this in a different room for a few days.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s very normal for babies to seem more tired and distressed during sleep training, which is why we suggest lots of extra cuddles and happy play together during awake time. Some ideas include having a bath or shower together for some skin-to-skin contact and bringing them into your bed in the morning for cuddles when you both wake up.</span></p>",

1.8 Settling and Calming Babies,FAQs - Settling and Calming Babies,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Is it ok to feed/rock/hold my baby to sleep?ANS:</strong> In the newborn period, it is absolutely ok to feed, hold, and rock your baby to sleep. This time is so important in establishing breastfeeding and bonding with your new baby to ensure they feel loved and secure. The newborn period is also a time of “survival” in a lot of ways, and you just have to do what you can to get some sleep. I always suggest trying to pop your baby down to sleep while awake or drowsy, but if it doesn’t work, then remember that tomorrow is a new day. Once you get to 3 weeks and beyond, it is best to try to put your baby down ‘sleepy’ but not ‘sleeping’—this will encourage and enable your baby to self-soothe and settle off to sleep alone. At the end of a sleep cycle (i.e., 45 minutes), a baby who was rocked/fed to sleep will wonder where the parent has gone and will struggle to stitch another sleep cycle together. If they settled by themselves in the first place, they are more likely to re-settle for another cycle.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I'm feeling overwhelmed at tackling both day naps and overnight sleep. Is it ok to work on one thing at a time or will this confuse my baby?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, it's ok to work on one thing at a time! Just do what you can, and often by working on day naps first, for example, overnight sleep improves dramatically as your baby isn't as overtired, and vice versa.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Should I put my baby down for each sleep in their bassinet/cot?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> If you're at home, then it's always good to get into the habit of putting your baby down in their cot or bassinet. However, it's also important to get out of the house for fresh air and social interaction. A good balance is the 80/20 rule—most sleep (80%) occurs in a normal sleep environment (their nursery, daycare, grandparent’s house, etc.), but on-the-go life (20%) is allowed to happen too! If you're wanting to head out and your baby needs a nap, the best naps to offer while out and about are the first nap of the day and the last nap of the day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: I'm finding resettling my baby every day really tiring and stressful, and he/she continues to wake after one sleep cycle. What can I do?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> At this age, it's ok to continue the nap in a pram, carrier, or as a contact nap to help your baby get some more sleep. It's VERY age-appropriate for babies to only be able to do one sleep cycle at this stage and then wake up, and some babies don't learn to link their sleep cycles until 4–5 months old. Be kind to yourself, and if the resettling every day is exhausting, then just try it a couple of times a week. Eventually, your baby will learn to sleep for longer.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: It's really hard to put my baby down to sleep in the cot for the last brief nap of the day. What can I do about this?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> This is VERY common, and babies will often fight this nap the older they get (more about this in the Big Baby program). It's fine to offer this brief nap as an assisted one, so that means trying things like holding them, using the carrier, pram, or car seat. Our goal is for them to have a brief nap as per the routine to ensure they aren't going to bed overtired at night.</span></p>",

1.9 The Role of Dads and Non-Breastfeeding Parents,FAQs - Non-Breastfeeding Parents,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do I do if the non-breastfeeding parent is away overnight?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: Breastfeeding mums ask me all the time what they’re meant to do if dad’s not home or away for work—and they need to resettle their baby when trying to establish a new routine. The best thing you can do is put on one of the non-breastfeeding parent’s shirts or jumpers, masking the smell of breastmilk and letting the baby think it’s not mum coming to feed.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do we do if the non-breastfeeding parent is regularly away from home with a FIFO (fly in, fly out) role, for example?</strong><br>ANS: When sleep training and introducing a new routine, consistency is always key, but this can be tricky for some families. If the non-breastfeeding parent is away regularly, I still recommend the baby be settled by them as much as possible. In some cases, this would mean the breastfeeding mother does 3 nights a week (masked in their partner’s top—see above) and the non-breastfeeding parent does 4 nights a week. If in a FIFO role, I recommend implementing the routines and new settling techniques in a period when both caregivers are home for a week together, and the non-breastfeeding parent remains the key settler whenever they are home.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do I do if I’m a single breastfeeding parent? Can the Dr. Golly Sleep Program still work for me?</strong><br>ANS: The answer is yes. Selecting consistent routines and settling techniques while following the winding and nutrition advice in the program should help you achieve great outcomes—it just might be a bit tougher and take a bit longer to achieve the desired results. If you have signed up for the program because your baby is particularly unsettled, this is a great opportunity to ask for help from loved ones. Exhaustion and stress are two key factors that dramatically reduce milk supply, and hungry babies tend to be very unsettled. Having someone stay with you for a week while you implement a new routine and have them do the overnight settling may be incredibly helpful for both your physical and mental health.</span></p>",

1.11 Maternal Nutrition,What To Eat,"<p><br></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When you’re breastfeeding, your body needs extra nutrients. That’s because your body is working harder to make breastmilk full of nutrients for your baby. &nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Producing breastmilk requires energy. Some women find they need to increase their normal diet by 50% or an extra 400-500 calories per day, to make enough milk to meet their baby’s needs; extra body fat gained during pregnancy is one way of providing mothers with the necessary calories to make this milk.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For mothers keen to reduce weight after delivery, it’s important to consider a gradual return to pre-birth weight, as any sudden weight loss can result in a dramatic reduction in milk production, associated with the sudden loss of body fat.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The recommendations for daily intake in breastfeeding mothers are:<br></strong>● vegetables – 7½ serves a day<br>● fruit – 2 serves a day<br>● grain foods – 9 serves a day<br>● protein – 2½ serves a day<br>● dairy or calcium-enriched products – 2½ serves a day</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’re eating a healthy and varied diet, you will get enough of most nutrients, but there are a few to be specifically aware of:</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Calcium:&nbsp;</strong>Calcium makes up an important part of breastmilk and is very important for your baby’s bone development. You get calcium from:<br>● dairy products like milk, cheese and yoghurt (be aware of possible cow milk intolerance in babies)<br>● calcium-enriched products, like some brands of soy milk<br>● fish with edible bones, like sardines and salmon<br>● tofu<br>● some green leafy vegetables like kale and bok choy<br>● white beans, figs, sesame seeds, almonds, broccoli, seaweed</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Iodine:&nbsp;</strong>Your baby depends on your breast milk as a source of iodine , which keeps the brain and nervous system developing. You get iodine from dairy products, seafood, iodised salt, potatoes, cheese, cranberries, tuna, shellfish and dried prunes. Iodine deficiency in breastfeeding mothers can be a risk for babies. So when you’re breastfeeding, it’s recommended that you take an iodine supplement of 150 micrograms (μg) per day. If you have any pre-existing thyroid problems, check with your doctor before taking a supplement.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br><strong>Vitamin B12:&nbsp;</strong>Vitamin B12 is very important for your baby’s developing nervous system. You get vitamin B12 from meat, fish (especially shellfish, tuna), eggs, milk, yoghurt, brewer’s yeast and fortified breakfast cereals. Those on vegetarian/vegan diets or taking antibiotics or anti-inflammatories may have reduced vitamin B12 levels.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Vitamin D:&nbsp;</strong>Vitamin D helps your baby absorb calcium, which your baby will need for bone growth and development. Your body makes most of the vitamin D you need from exposure to sunlight. There are also small amounts of Vitamin D in oily fish, fish oils supplements, egg yolks, mushrooms, milk, ricotta cheese and butter. You might be at risk of vitamin D deficiency if you’re dark-skinned, keep all of your skin covered or rarely go outdoors. If you’re deficient, you and your baby might need to take a vitamin D supplement.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Iron:</strong>Iron helps the body make haemoglobin, the major part of red blood cells, helping us deliver oxygen around the body. When iron deficient - or anaemic - you may feel lower energy levels. To increase this, eat more brown rice, soybean, oysters, chicken, beef, turkey, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds and green leafy vegetables. To further maximise your iron absorption, when eating these foods, add some vitamin C (from citrus fruits) and be sure to avoid excess dairy - as this reduces iron absorption.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Zinc:&nbsp;</strong>Zinc is a crucial ingredient in our immune system. It can be found in red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, oats, seeds and seafood.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Omega 3 fatty acids:&nbsp;</strong>These occur naturally in flax seeds, chia seeds, salmon, walnuts, tofu, oysters, canola oil, brussel sprouts and avocados.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Vegan and vegetarian mothers&nbsp;</strong>may experience lower milk supply or fatigue due to reduced B12 intake. Calcium, protein and iron levels may also be reduced. To help the body absorb iron, add foods high in vitamin C such as citrus fruits.

For calcium, include dairy products (unless vegan), dark green vegetables, calcium-enriched and fortified products, such as juices, cereals, soy milk, soy yoghurt and tofu. There is no need to eat against your beliefs, but have your nutrient levels checked and supplement these if any are low - it is not only important for your baby - it’s also crucial for you and your energy levels.</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.375rem;text-align: left""><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Fluids:&nbsp;</strong>Water intake is crucial, and never more so than when breastfeeding. Most mothers will attest to insatiable thirst during the breastfeeding period and this is not surprising - given the water content of breastmilk! The recommended ‘2 litres per day’ is a good starting point, but drink more if you remain thirsty. Be careful not to drink excessive amounts; excessive water intake does not result in more milk production and can worsen oedema (swelling). Avoid soft drinks, fruit juices, flavoured milk, flavoured water, sports drinks and energy drinks too.</span></p>",
1.11 Maternal Nutrition,What To Eat,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Whether you’re breastfeeding or formula feeding, it's very important to look after yourself with a new baby. Your body will be transitioning back to its pre-pregnant state and also recovering from the birth. Ensure you are eating a well-varied diet and drinking plenty of water.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you are breastfeeding, your body needs extra nutrients. That’s because your body is working harder to make breastmilk full of nutrients for your baby.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Producing breastmilk requires energy.</em></strong> Some women find they need to increase their normal diet by 50% or an extra 400-500 calories per day to make enough milk to meet their baby’s needs. Extra body fat gained during pregnancy is one way of providing mothers with the necessary calories to make this milk. For mothers keen to reduce weight after delivery, it’s important to consider a gradual return to pre-birth weight, as any sudden weight loss can result in a dramatic reduction of milk production, associated with the sudden loss of body fat.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>The recommendations for daily intake in breastfeeding mothers are:</em></strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Vegetables – 7½ serves a day</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Fruit – 2 serves a day</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Grain foods – 9 serves a day</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Protein – 2½ serves a day</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Dairy or calcium-enriched products – 2½ serves a day</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’re eating a healthy and varied diet, you will get enough of most nutrients. But there are a few to be specifically aware of:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Calcium:</strong> Calcium makes up an important part of breastmilk and is very important for your baby’s bone development. You get calcium from:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Dairy products like milk, cheese and yoghurt (be aware of possible cow milk intolerance in babies)</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Calcium-enriched products like some brands of soy milk</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Fish with edible bones, like sardines and salmon</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Tofu</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Some green leafy vegetables like kale and bok choy</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">White beans, figs, sesame seeds, almonds, broccoli, seaweed</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Iodine:</strong> Your baby depends on your breast milk as a source of iodine, which keeps the brain and nervous system developing. You get iodine from:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Dairy products, seafood, iodised salt and bread made with iodised salt</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Potatoes, cheese, cranberries, tuna, shellfish, dried prunes</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Iodine deficiency in breastfeeding mothers can be a risk for babies. So when you’re breastfeeding, it’s recommended that you take an iodine supplement of 150 micrograms (μg) per day. If you have any pre-existing thyroid problems, check with your doctor before taking a supplement.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Vitamin B12:</strong> Vitamin B12 is very important for your baby’s developing nervous system. You get vitamin B12 from:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Meat, fish (especially shellfish, tuna), eggs, milk, yoghurt, brewer’s yeast, and fortified breakfast cereals</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Those on vegetarian/vegan diets or taking antibiotics or anti-inflammatories may have reduced B12.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Vitamin D helps your baby absorb calcium, which your baby will need for bone growth and development. Your body makes most of the vitamin D you need from exposure to sunlight. There are also small amounts of Vitamin D in:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Oily fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks, mushrooms, milk, ricotta cheese, and butter</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">You might be at risk of vitamin D deficiency if you’re dark-skinned, if you keep all of your skin covered, or if you rarely go outdoors. If you’re deficient, you and your baby might need to take a vitamin D supplement.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Iron:</strong> Iron helps the body make haemoglobin, the major part of red blood cells, helping us deliver oxygen around the body. When iron deficient – or anaemic – you may feel lower energy levels. To increase this, eat more:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Brown rice, soybean, oysters, chicken, beef, turkey, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, and green leafy vegetables</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">To further maximise your iron absorption, when eating these foods, add some vitamin C (from citrus fruits) and be sure to avoid excess dairy, as this reduces iron absorption.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Zinc:</strong> Zinc is a crucial ingredient in our immune system. It can be found in:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, oats, seeds, and seafood</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Omega 3 fatty acids:</strong> These occur naturally in:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Flax seeds, chia seeds, salmon, walnuts, tofu, oysters, canola oil, Brussels sprouts, and avocados</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Vegan and vegetarian mothers</strong> may experience lower milk supply or fatigue due to reduced B12 intake. Calcium, protein, and iron levels may also be reduced. To help the body absorb iron, choose foods high in vitamin C such as citrus fruits. For protein, consider plant sources such as:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Soy products and meat substitutes, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds, and whole grains</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For calcium, include:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Dairy products, dark green vegetables, calcium-enriched and fortified products such as juices, cereals, soy milk, soy yogurt, and tofu</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There is no need to eat against your beliefs, but have your nutrient levels checked and supplement these if any are low – it is not only important for your baby but also crucial for you and your energy levels.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Fluids:</strong> Water intake is crucial, and never more so than when breastfeeding.

1.13 Managing Common Breastfeeding Problems,Expressing Breastmilk,"<p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When your newborn baby is placed in your arms for the first time, you hope that your baby will be able to successfully breastfeed, but the reality is that not all newborns will be able to achieve this. If direct breastfeeding is not possible, expressing your breasts is the next best option.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Expressing &amp; Colostrum:</strong><br>In the first 24-48 hours, the first milk produced is called colostrum, a rich, sticky milk that’s full of goodness designed to protect your baby. Colostrum is generally all your baby needs until your milk comes in, which usually happens around day 2-3. Because of its thick consistency, hand expressing is the best method for removal, as your fingers can press deep enough into the breast tissue to drain the colostrum forward toward the nipple, where it can be easily removed. During this time, it is also vital that the breasts are stimulated regularly (8+ times a day) with a hospital-grade pump.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Expressing &amp; Establishing Milk Supply:</strong><br>Early stimulation is the most effective way to establish a milk supply that meets your baby’s needs and provides the foundation for long-term milk production and continued breastfeeding. Once your milk has <em>come in</em>, and your baby is still unable to breastfeed, continue to express to feed your baby your breastmilk. Combining hand expressing with pumping has been shown to yield more milk. Double pumping (both breasts at the same time) will speed things up, removing the milk in half the time and helping to increase your supply if you are struggling with low supply. Remember to drop back to single pumping and remove just enough for comfort from the second breast if you suddenly find you are developing an oversupply.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Frequency:</strong><br>Expressing 8-12 times in 24 hours is the recommended frequency to establish a milk supply that will meet your baby’s needs for the long term. Each pump session should only take approximately 10-15 minutes or until your milk flow reduces to drops. A hospital-grade pump will ensure you can remove the milk efficiently and comfortably and is more practical if you are pumping more than 3 times a day.</span></p><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/44e/cbc/119/1616025561081.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""1616025561081.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>",
1.14 Development,General Development 4-16 Weeks,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By <strong>week 4</strong>, babies are becoming <strong>increasingly sensitive</strong>. You could take a 1-week-old to a music concert, and they would sleep through it, but by three weeks and beyond, they are more sensitive to stimuli from the external world, as well as the internal world (inside their bodies). This is why <strong>colic</strong> often starts at this age—babies can no longer ‘tolerate’ whatever is causing discomfort. This is a normal part of their development, but it can still be frustrating when your previously sound sleeper now wakes more frequently, often after just one sleep cycle (40-45 minutes).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Linking sleep cycles and sleeping for <strong>1-2 hours or more independently</strong> is a learned skill, and some babies don’t master this until closer to <strong>4-5 months</strong>. The best way to encourage your baby to link their sleep cycles is by following a program to create <strong>healthy sleep habits early</strong>. This includes setting up an <strong>ideal sleep environment</strong>, watching their <strong>awake times and tired signs</strong>, and establishing a <strong>rhythm</strong> for your baby’s day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This <strong>increased sensitivity</strong> also comes with <strong>increased awareness</strong>, so you may notice your baby trying to <strong>track you with their eyes</strong>. Move close to your baby’s face, interact with them, <strong>sing, talk, smile, and give kisses</strong>. While they may not respond much until around <strong>6 weeks</strong>, they will still enjoy this early form of <strong>play</strong>, which is an important step in their <strong>language, social, and communication development</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s also important to note that for some babies, <strong>catnapping at this age is developmentally normal</strong>. If <strong>resettling your baby</strong> after a short nap is too stressful and exhausting (<strong>let’s be honest—it can be utterly exhausting!</strong>), try resettling them <strong>1-2 times a day</strong> but don’t stress about it for every nap. If they only take a short nap, you may need to <strong>bring their next awake time forward slightly</strong> to compensate. When resettling feels overwhelming, consider using a <strong>pram, baby carrier, or car seat</strong> to extend their nap.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Remember that short naps happen sometimes, and tomorrow is a new day!</em></strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By <strong>4 weeks</strong>, babies will also have <strong>improved head control</strong>, so it’s good to encourage <strong>tummy time</strong> when possible (and when tolerated). As they <strong>master tummy time</strong>, they will begin to explore <strong>rolling</strong>. Most babies roll from <strong>front to back around 5 months</strong> once their <strong>arm muscles have strengthened</strong>. <strong>Rolling from back to front</strong> typically happens <strong>1-2 months later</strong>. However, <strong>every baby is different</strong>—some start rolling as early as <strong>4 months</strong>, while others <strong>skip this step entirely</strong> and go straight to <strong>unsupported sitting and crawling</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By <strong>3-4 months</strong>, your baby is not only <strong>growing rapidly</strong> but also becoming <strong>far more active</strong>. While they may not move very far yet, they explore movement by <strong>throwing their limbs around</strong>. Try lying on the floor and moving all four limbs for <strong>30 seconds</strong>—it’s quite a workout, like doing <strong>star-jumps or burpees!</strong></span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>This extra movement burns more calories and requires more milk as fuel.</em></strong></span></h3>",
1.14 Development,A Note on the Wonder Weeks,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Many parents will have heard of the publication, <em><strong>The Wonder Weeks</strong></em>. This English version of a Dutch book released in 1992 draws on data dating back to Jane Goodall’s experience observing chimpanzees in the 1970s. It was written by a psychologist and ethologist (someone who studies animal behaviors) and describes <strong>10 predictable developmental ‘leaps’</strong> that coincide with <strong>unsettled behavior and sleep regression</strong>. This provides solace to parents who are trying to understand why their child is unsettled and gives them permission to <strong>‘ride it out’</strong> until the leap is finished.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Sounds lovely. Unfortunately, it’s <strong>completely false</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Child development is a fluid process</strong>—it occurs on a <strong>continuum at different times and at different velocities for every child</strong>. There are countless variables and influences that alter the rate of child development, so forcing this <strong>complex, astonishing process</strong> into ten conveniently discreet packages is simply <strong>misleading</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">You would never state that a baby <strong>learns to sit independently the day they turn 6 months old</strong>. This milestone can occur at <strong>5 months or just as easily at 8 months</strong>, and sitting is a relatively straightforward <strong>gross motor development</strong>! So how can you predict <strong>complex neurological breakthroughs</strong> in a newborn?</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Moreover, I find it <strong>potentially dangerous</strong>. I would never want a parent to <strong>dismiss unsettled behavior as ‘just another leap, because my app said so’</strong> while potentially <strong>missing a treatable cause</strong> for poor feeding or reduced sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em><strong>The Wonder Weeks</strong></em> has been <strong>discredited</strong> by more recent studies conducted by <strong>pediatricians and behavioral psychologists</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There are <strong>some positives</strong> about the program, particularly in how it encourages parents to <strong>interact with their babies</strong> and support their development. However, simply <strong>playing with your child</strong> will achieve the <strong>exact same thing</strong>—without the <strong>erroneous parental pressure</strong> or <strong>unnecessary guilt</strong> if they don’t follow a prescribed developmental timeline.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Development happens through play and interaction.</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">You don’t need to research every milestone or try to <strong>force</strong> the next step.</span></p>",
1.14 Development,"Poo (Stool, Bowel Action)","<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">We don’t like to see white/pale stools, black (once the first stool of meconium has passed) or red; these babies need to see a doctor.&nbsp;Many parents have concerns regarding the frequency of their child’s bowel actions and worry their child might be constipated. When thinking of constipation, look at the consistency of the bowel action, not the frequency with which it is passed. Some babies will poo with every feed, others may only poo once a week. As long as the stool is soft and easily passed, you shouldn’t worry about how frequently the baby is pooing. Breastfed babies are almost never constipated.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><a download=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923644650x950104456857890400/Dr%20Golly%20-%20Poo%20Chart%20-%20Print%20Version.pdf?_gl=1*1c2y6oq*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923644650x950104456857890400/Dr%20Golly%20-%20Poo%20Chart%20-%20Print%20Version.pdf?_gl=1*1c2y6oq*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" data-image-link=""image""><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/98f/b1d/faa/Dr_Golly_-_Poo_Chart_-_Website_Version.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""Dr_Golly_-_Poo_Chart_-_Website_Version.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" data-image-link=""https://25c623a83912a41d23bcc5865ecf275d.cdn.bubble.io/f1741923644650x950104456857890400/Dr%20Golly%20-%20Poo%20Chart%20-%20Print%20Version.pdf?_gl=1*1c2y6oq*_gcl_au*MTI3OTI3MTM0MC4xNzM2ODIyMzE2*_ga*NzU4NzgzNDY4LjE2NjU0NTY5Mjg.*_ga_BFPVR2DEE2*MTc0MTkwNjQwNS42MS4xLjE3NDE5MjM3ODMuNTUuMC4w"" style=""""></a></figure></div>",
1.14 Development,Tummy Time,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tummy time is wonderful for <strong>promoting development</strong>, interacting with your baby, and enjoying some time without a focus on feeding or winding. Some babies, however, strongly dislike lying on their stomachs, and if this is the case with your baby, <strong>don’t feel the need to force it</strong>. Plenty of babies have very minimal time spent on their stomachs and still develop <strong>perfectly normally</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For babies who dislike tummy time, it’s worthwhile <strong>revisiting it every few weeks</strong>, as they tend to <strong>tolerate it better as they get older</strong>.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The History of Tummy Time:</strong></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Historically, <strong>SIDS rates were disturbingly high</strong>. When the <strong>American Academy of Pediatrics</strong> launched their <strong>Back-to-Sleep campaign</strong> in 1994, there was a phenomenal <strong>50% reduction in SIDS episodes</strong>. While this was undoubtedly <strong>successful</strong> and should never be challenged, placing children on their backs resulted in some <strong>unwanted side effects</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The first was <strong>flat-head syndrome</strong> (discussed later), and the next was <strong>delayed gross motor development</strong>. Babies spent less time on their stomachs, pushing up, strengthening their <strong>back, shoulder, and neck muscles</strong>, which delayed the strength and coordination required for <strong>sitting, standing, etc.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Importantly, though, <strong>researchers who conducted the 1998 study</strong> found that <strong>back-sleepers eventually developed their motor skills just fine</strong>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">“All infants achieved all milestones within the accepted normal age range,” they wrote.</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Another study published that same year reached a <strong>similar conclusion</strong>—that although babies who spent less time on their tummies developed <strong>motor skills more slowly</strong>, the <strong>discrepancies didn’t last</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">And in a <strong>2008 study</strong>, researchers reported that babies who were given <strong>more awake tummy timerolled and crawled earlier</strong> than babies who were given less, but they <strong>didn’t learn to sit or walk any sooner</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Interestingly, researchers have also found ties between <strong>when babies develop gross motor skills and when they develop certain cognitive skills</strong>—which raises questions over whether <strong>tummy time might also make kids ‘smarter.’</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Studies have found that infants who are able to <strong>sit up</strong> have a <strong>more advanced understanding</strong> of the three-dimensional nature of objects, <strong>perhaps because they can more easily explore and inspect their toys</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Babies who have spent more time <strong>crawling and walking</strong>, regardless of their age, also have <strong>better spatial memory skills</strong>. And a <strong>2014 study</strong> found that babies often <strong>learn to walk right before they develop language skills</strong>—so if they learn to walk later, <strong>they might talk later too</strong>.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em><strong>So, yes: Tummy time is good — but you don’t need to overly fret about it. And keep in mind that just a minute or two — even just 30 seconds — of tummy time will add up if you do it regularly.</strong></em></span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby <strong>really hates it</strong>, try <strong>placing them on their tummy on your chest</strong> instead of on the floor.</span></p>",
1.14 Development,Tummy Time,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By the time your child is enjoying solids, they will have adequate head control but may still be developing trunk strength and co-ordination.

But some babies strongly dislike lying on their stomachs and if this is the case with your baby, don’t feel the need to force it.

During gestation, the size of the baby is determined by many factors, including:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">The health of the placenta</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">The umbilical cord</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">The possibility of gestational diabetes</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Gestation length</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Maternal blood pressure</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once the baby is born, assuming we’re talking about a well baby who is feeding and growing happily at home with an adequate milk supply, their weight is determined more by their:</span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Feeding patterns</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Genetics</li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Take, for example, a baby born to two parents who themselves sit low on weight centiles, yet with a mother affected by gestational diabetes who delivers a baby on the 90th centile. This baby is highly unlikely to live on the 90th centile for life. If they were genetically predetermined to be closer to the 15th centile, for example, they will grow and thrive but will steadily drop down the centiles (always growing in weight but dropping in centiles) until they reach the 15th centile.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This commonly occurs in the first few months of life and can explain the drop in centiles, despite the presence of a perfectly happy, healthy baby. It is crucial to remember that any drop in centiles needs to be monitored closely and the threshold for referral should remain low. But once more concerning problems have been comfortably excluded, we can rest assured that this baby is still thriving while simply finding their place on the centiles chart.</span></p>",

There’s some terrible language we use around babies and newborns that adds to this confusion and leads to overdiagnosis and overmedication.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The difference between “refluxed milk” and a diagnosis of “gastro-oesophageal reflux disease” (GORD)</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Many people incorrectly refer to small amounts of “refluxed milk” or “spills,” “up chucks,” or “possets” of milk as a reflux diagnosis or signs of reflux in babies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Small spills or possets of milk by a happy, growing baby are completely normal. They don’t cause unsettledness and don’t require specific investigation or management.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Nearly all babies will posset milk from time to time. Some healthy babies posset LOTS of milk – you’ll identify their parents with a cloth over their shoulder or milk down the front of their shirts. These babies are gaining weight and are settled – often referred to as “happy spitters.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Why babies ‘reflux’ milk</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When a baby feeds, the stomach becomes over-stretched, especially if it is full of milk and wind. Any muscle in the body desires to return to its original size, rebounding much like an untied balloon deflates rapidly when released.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In babies who reflux a significant amount of milk, the lower esophageal sphincter muscle is often not fully developed and allows stomach contents to rise back up the esophagus.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This can result in a column of milk rising up the oesophagus (feeding tube) and spilling out, causing your baby to spit up or “reflux” milk.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP:</strong> By deflating the stomach with more winding, we can reduce the chance of that rising column of milk.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>There are generally four types of ‘vomit’ that need to be defined:</strong></span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px""><p><strong>Posset:</strong> A small volume, effortless ejection of milk. This occurs in almost half of all babies, usually before 2 months of age, peaking at 4 months. These babies, known as “happy spitters,” do not require treatment.</p></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><p><strong>Vomit:</strong> An ejection of stomach contents involving retching/gagging. This empties the stomach, and the lost milk needs to be replaced. Large but infrequent vomits are not problematic, but recurrent vomiting needs investigation.</p></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><p><strong>Projectile vomit:</strong> This occurs when the stomach is obstructed, often due to pyloric stenosis. It is dramatic (hitting the ceiling or wall) and requires urgent medical attention. Bright green vomit is also a medical emergency.</p></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><p><strong>True reflux (GORD):</strong> This is an uncommon condition where frequent milk reflux leads to feed refusal, poor growth, bloody vomits, irritability, and chronic cough.

1.16 Getting Out of the House,Looking After Your Physical and Mental Health,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Getting out of the house is so important for your physical and mental health, even if it’s just for a little walk around the block once a day. At this age, babies will sleep happily in the pram/pusher/stroller, carrier or car seat so I encourage you to get out when you can.&nbsp;Aim for at least 1 nap at home in their bassinet/cot though, as we don’t want your baby getting too reliant on movement for sleep, or overstimulated by multiple adventures during the day.&nbsp;A breathable blackout cover for the pram and portable white noise machine can be helpful if using the pram as we are recreating their sleep environment like at home as much as possible.&nbsp;When using a pram for day naps, having a bassinet attachment is helpful so that your baby can remain flat and swaddled and continue sleeping when either leaving the house or returning home. The sit-up/strap in pram seats are useful for older babies but they will often wake up after 1 sleep cycle.If your baby does nod off in the car that’s ok, however, the AAP and SIDS guidelines recommend moving your baby to a flat, firm sleeping surface once you arrive at your destination as car seats are not designed for long sleep periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>",
