🛠 REPLIT DEV FIX PROMPT: SIGNUP FLOW UI & LOGIC CORRECTIONS
This is a follow-up prompt to fix layout and logic issues across the 3-step signup flow (/signup, /createprofile, /preferences). Please follow each instruction carefully to align with UX best practices and match design references provided earlier.

🔹 STEP 1 — /signup
❌ Issues:
First/Last name fields are showing here incorrectly

T&Cs + Marketing checkboxes not styled correctly

Button order and structure is off

✅ Fix Instructions:
Remove First Name and Last Name from Step 1 — they now belong only to Step 2 (/createprofile)

Move checkbox components from Step 2 into Step 1, styled as per current Step 2:

✅ Checkbox 1: "By signing up, you agree to the Dr Golly Terms of Service" (linked to /terms)

✅ Checkbox 2 (pre-checked): "By opting in, you agree to receive marketing materials."

Use modern checkbox components with left-aligned checkmarks and label text

Position buttons after checkboxes:

Google login and Create Account buttons should come after both checkboxes

Button layout:

Primary CTA: “Create Account”

Separator: “OR”

Secondary CTA: “Sign up with Google”

Ensure consistent logo placement:

Dr Golly logo should appear top-centre, same style on all steps

🔹 STEP 2 — /createprofile
❌ Issues:
First/Last Name appear again (should only show here, not in Step 1)

Checkboxes are duplicated (should not appear here)

Profile picture uploader is misaligned

"Which best describes you" pills are overflowing the container

Layout lacks visual breadcrumbs / progress indicators

✅ Fix Instructions:
Only show First Name + Last Name here, not in previous step

Remove both checkboxes (they now live only on Step 1)

Style profile picture upload as follows:

Circular avatar upload icon

Centred above form fields

Display user initials or default avatar if no upload

Clickable to upload from device

Fix container wrap issue on pills:

Parent / Grandparent / Carer should be inline, wrapped cleanly inside card container

Maintain clear selected/unselected styling

Add breadcrumb navigation (top-left or top-centre), e.g.:

sql
Copy
Edit
Step 2 of 3 – Create Profile
Ensure Dr Golly logo is displayed top-centre, consistently across all steps

🔹 STEP 3 — /preferences
✅ No major issues reported here, but to ensure design continuity:

Maintain breadcrumbs (Step 3 of 3 – Preferences)

Maintain consistent CTA button style

Keep Dr Golly logo visible at the top

🧩 GLOBAL COMPONENT INTEGRITY
Apply the following globally across all steps:

Element	Requirement
✅ Dr Golly logo	Must be visible, top-centred, consistent on all steps
✅ Breadcrumbs	Display "Step X of 3" for user clarity
✅ Button styling	Use consistent mint/teal round buttons across all screens
✅ Mobile responsiveness	Ensure all layouts collapse cleanly on small screen widths
✅ Keyboard nav + labels	All inputs should support tabbing and use clear label text

Once these fixes are applied, please test all 3 steps across:

Desktop

iOS Safari

Android Chrome

Mobile viewports in dev tools

And confirm:

Field logic flows as described

Visual layout is consistent with screenshots and design references

Stripe and Klayvio events are not broken
