6.1 Top of Funnel Links – Freebies Tracking Logic
Purpose:
Track engagement and revenue generated from free downloadable content (“freebies”) posted under /blog.

Technical Requirements:

Any time a new blog post is created where the URL path includes /blog/free-… (e.g., /blog/free-download-for-starting-solids, /blog/free-bedtime-routine-chart), the system must:

Detect that the post is a “freebie” based on the /blog/free- prefix in its slug.

Automatically generate a unique tracking URL for that freebie.

Tracking URL should preserve the original URL destination.

Append a unique tracking identifier (similar to UTM parameters) so that clicks on this tracking link can be attributed to this specific freebie in TOF reporting.

Example:

Original URL: /blog/free-bedtime-routine-chart

Tracking URL: /t/of/blog/free-bedtime-routine-chart?trackid=abc123 (format is flexible — final structure should be consistent across freebies).

The unique tracking URL should:

Redirect seamlessly to the original blog post URL.

Allow backend tracking of:

Clicks (each time a user opens the tracking URL).

Sales (if the tracked user later purchases a product in the same session or within a defined attribution window).

Revenue (total purchase amount attributed to the tracked click).

Data Storage:

Create a top_of_funnel_links table (or equivalent in existing schema) with:

id (unique identifier)

original_url (string)

tracking_url (string)

click_count (integer)

sales_count (integer)

total_revenue (decimal/currency)

created_at (datetime)

Admin Display:

Populate the new TOF tab table with all records from top_of_funnel_links.

Display tracking URL in “TOF URL” column (with copy-to-clipboard).

Display live click, sales, and revenue counts for each link.

Goal:
Enable marketing and content teams to see, in the Top of Funnel tab, how much traffic and revenue each freebie download is driving — using unique tracking URLs in a similar manner to UTM-based analytics.

Testing Requirements:

Publish a new /blog/free-... post, confirm system auto-generates a tracking URL and adds entry to TOF table.

Confirm that clicking the tracking URL redirects to original blog URL.

Validate that clicks, sales, and revenue update in real-time or at defined intervals.

Ensure sorting works in TOF tab.
