Desktop Viewport Optimisation for Public Checkout Page (No Functional Changes)

The checkout functionality is confirmed working as expected across public flows (unauthenticated and authenticated), and it performs correctly on mobile and small-to-medium screen sizes. This prompt is strictly to add screen responsiveness improvements for large desktop displays (e.g. 27" iMac), while protecting all existing functionality and mobile styles.

Objective
Enhance the layout of the public checkout page on large screens (width ≥ 1440px) for improved readability and spatial efficiency, without changing:

Any backend or frontend functionality

Stripe integration

Checkout behaviour

Mobile or tablet responsiveness

Instructions
Media Query Targeting Large Screens:

Add a responsive media query for screens min-width: 1440px or larger.

Target only desktop-specific containers and paddings.

Avoid using fixed widths or heights that could break smaller layouts.

Checkout Container Adjustments:

Introduce a max-width (e.g. 1100px–1200px) to the main checkout wrapper.

Centre the checkout container horizontally using margin: 0 auto.

Add generous horizontal padding (e.g. 2rem–4rem) for visual comfort.

Column Expansion (Optional):

If the design is split into two panels (e.g. form left, order summary right), consider increasing the space between them (gap: 2rem–3rem) for improved balance.

Ensure No Impact On:

Functionality of the checkout process

Mobile-first styles or logic

Form submission, payment button behaviour, or redirect logic

Example CSS (for guidance only, do not enforce blindly)

Edit
@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
  .checkout-wrapper {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem 4rem;
    display: flex;
    gap: 3rem;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }

  .checkout-form,
  .checkout-summary {
    flex: 1;
  }
}
Notes
Do not modify or wrap elements in new divs unless absolutely necessary.

Test thoroughly on:

Mobile (≤768px)

Tablet (768–1024px)

Standard desktop (1024–1440px)

Large desktop (1440px+)
