Logic Regression – Must Be Fixed Immediately
The following logic issue was introduced during recent layout work and must be fixed before continuing:

When a coupon is applied, the Stripe card entry fields become unclickable or visually blocked.

This breaks the core payment flow and is not acceptable.

Fix Requirements:

Restore full interactivity of the card fields when a coupon is applied.

Do not change or interfere with any other existing checkout functionality.

Ensure the following continue to work:

Coupon validation and discount calculation

Stripe payment submission

Form field inputs and layout

This fix must be thoroughly tested before moving forward with any visual updates.

Once Functionality Is Fully Restored and Verified
After logic is fully stable and tested, apply the following frontend-only updates. These changes must not affect any working logic.

UI Layout Adjustments (Mobile-First for /checkout-new)
1. Header Banner Logo and Text

Position the logo to the left of the header text:
“You’re one step closer to better sleep for your baby!”

Use horizontal layout and consistent alignment (e.g. flex with spacing)

2. Product Image Correction
The image currently displaying in the cart appears to be a user profile image.

Check the image field being pulled from the database and ensure it uses the correct product image for the course.
