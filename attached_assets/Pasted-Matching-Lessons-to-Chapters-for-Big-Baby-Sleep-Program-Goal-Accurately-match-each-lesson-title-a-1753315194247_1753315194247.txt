Matching Lessons to Chapters for "Big Baby Sleep Program"
Goal:
Accurately match each lesson title and its corresponding content to the appropriate chapter within the Big Baby Sleep Program, based on the verified spreadsheet of reference matches. Do not generate new content — only use supplied data.

🔍 Instructions:
Use the following inputs:

Chapters.csv: Contains chapter names, numbers and order for "Big Baby Sleep Program".

Lessons.csv: Contains all available lesson titles and verified written content.

Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv: This is your master reference for confirmed, verified matches.

Constraints & Matching Logic:

Only use content that exists in Lessons.csv.

Cross-check every lesson against the Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv to ensure accuracy and prevent AI generation.

Chapter names should follow the structure in the screenshots and Chapters.csv (e.g., “1.3 Routine”).

Lesson names must exactly match those shown in the screenshots (e.g., "Routine 4–6 Months", "Early Morning Waking Tips & FAQs").

Every match must pull 100% of its content directly from the Lessons.csv, based on a verified link in the reference sheet.

Validation Checks:

✅ Check that the lesson name from the screenshot exists in the reference match file.

✅ Confirm that the corresponding content is pulled directly from Lessons.csv without modification.

✅ Ensure there are no duplicate lessons under any chapter.

✅ Ensure no extra or unreferenced lessons are added to a chapter.

✅ Flag any unmatched lessons as UNMATCHED and do not populate fallback content.

Guardrails:

❌ Do not use AI to fill gaps or generate fallback content.

❌ Do not make assumptions based on name similarity alone — match must be explicitly verified in Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv.

✅ If screenshots are available for future chapters, use those to validate lesson titles exactly.

✅ You may use Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv as the authoritative reference for exact matches.

Output Format:
Generate a clean output CSV or structured data table with the following columns:

Chapter Name

Lesson Name (as shown in chapter structure)

Matched Lesson Title

Matched Lesson Content (from Lessons.csv)
