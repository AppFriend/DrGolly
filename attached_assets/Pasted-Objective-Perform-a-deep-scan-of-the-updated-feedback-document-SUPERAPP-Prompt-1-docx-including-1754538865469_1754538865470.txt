Objective:
Perform a deep scan of the updated feedback document (SUPERAPP Prompt (1).docx) including annotated screenshots, then:

Return a structured list of proposed changes for approval

Wait for confirmation

Once approved, implement changes with precise frontend logic

üß† STEP 1 ‚Äì Deep Scan & Structured Change Proposal
‚úÖ Instructions:
Parse the Updated Document:

Carefully read through all rows in SUPERAPP Prompt (1).docx

Interpret all screenshots as definitive design references‚Äîthese override any ambiguous text feedback

Ensure that suggestions like layout, colours, or icon removals are clearly extracted

Output a Structured Change Log with the Following Format:

diff
Copy
Edit
- Page / Component: (e.g. /profile, /courses, Header, Checkout)
- Feedback Summary: (‚ÄúLong emails are bunched on mobile‚Äù)
- Screenshot Reference: (location or design block in doc)
- Proposed Change:
  ‚Ä¢ Visual Update (CSS/layout, icons, spacing)
  ‚Ä¢ Functional Update (routing, button behaviour, modal etc.)
- Dev Implementation Notes:
  ‚Ä¢ Assumptions (e.g. which component structure is used)
  ‚Ä¢ Affected breakpoints (mobile vs desktop)
  ‚Ä¢ Any third-party libraries involved
Do not implement yet.
Submit the full list back for approval.

üß∞ STEP 2 ‚Äì Implement Approved Changes
Once approved, action each change with the following development instructions:

üîÑ COMPONENT-BY-COMPONENT INSTRUCTIONS
/profile Page
Issue	Instruction
Upgrade button does nothing	Ensure button links to /manage route using valid Link or navigate() handler
Long emails look bunched	Add word-break: break-all; or truncate with tooltip fallback
"F" icon next to Free Plan	Remove the icon, leave ‚ÄúFree Plan‚Äù as text
Gold ring around avatar	Conditionally style avatar wrapper if user.plan === "gold"

Header Redesigns (Based on Screenshot Sections)
Plan Type	Instruction
Free Plan header	Update /profile header per design reference, spacing, font weight, and text align
Gold Plan header	Apply distinct design shown in screenshot (e.g. full-width badge, plan highlights)

Combined Account Tab (New Design)
Reconstruct this section using flex layout with margin/padding specified in screenshot

Validate it responds correctly to mobile resizing

/courses Page
Issue	Instruction
Button for "Unlimited Access with Gold"	Change CTA button styling for free users to use gold variant shown in doc
Visual distinction between buttons	Review all /courses buttons ‚Äî apply consistent padding, hover states, and border-radius
Ensure gold button shows only for non-gold users	Add conditional check: if user.plan !== "gold", show gold CTA

/family Tab
Redesign layout based on screenshot provided

Maintain heading styles, spacing, and child sections as per design mock

Blog Page
Issue	Instruction
Images not displaying	Validate all blog images have valid URLs, fallback alt handling, and responsive scaling
Lazy loading / CDN errors	Add check to pre-load key images and error boundary for broken images

Homepage ‚Üí Freebies (Mobile)
Issue	Instruction
Zooms on mobile after tapping	Prevent pinch/zoom on tap by adjusting viewport meta and ensuring inputs/buttons have correct touch scaling
meta name="viewport" fix	Use user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1 if necessary; test impact across Android + iOS

Add Payment Method
Button displays UI but doesn‚Äôt function

Fix click handler to open correct modal or route to /manage/payment

Add validation for card input and visual feedback on error

Global Design Consistency
Component	Instruction
Tabs	Style as rounded rectangles: e.g. border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px 12px
CTA Buttons	Style as rounded pills: e.g. border-radius: 9999px; font-weight: 600;
Button colours & states	Ensure primary, secondary, hover, disabled, and active styles are defined clearly in shared theme or scoped modules

‚úÖ STEP 3 ‚Äì QA Testing
Once all changes are implemented:

Test Across Breakpoints

iOS / Android

Chrome / Safari (desktop)

Responsive testing on /profile, /courses, /family, blog, and /manage

Cross-Check Screenshots

Confirm implementation visually matches provided screenshots

Interactive Checks

All CTAs and buttons open expected modals, pages, or forms

‚ÄúUpgrade Plan‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdd Payment Method‚Äù and avatar-based plan indicators function correctly

üì§ Next Action
Return the proposed list of changes using the structure provided in Step 1, referencing all feedback and screenshots.
Once approved, proceed with development using the instructions above.
