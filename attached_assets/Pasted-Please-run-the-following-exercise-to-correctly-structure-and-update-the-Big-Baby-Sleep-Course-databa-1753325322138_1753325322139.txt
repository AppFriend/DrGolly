Please run the following exercise to correctly structure and update the Big Baby Sleep Course database based on the read-only preview UI currently visible in the app. This structure reflects the approved course hierarchy and lesson associations. No spreadsheet or fallback logic is to be used — the visual preview is the definitive source of truth.

✅ Objective:

Use the visible course layout in the read-only preview to accurately assign lessons to the correct chapter.

Maintain strict fidelity to the lesson order, chapter titles, and grouping exactly as displayed in the app UI.

Ensure no fallback logic, no unmatched items, and no AI-generated lesson content is inserted — only structure existing data from the current lesson database.

📁 Requirements:

Course Name: Big Baby: 4–8 Months

Source of Truth: The app’s read-only preview (chapter headers and nested lessons).

Data Source: Use only existing lessons already in the database — match them based on title accuracy or known aliases.

📂 Structure to Build:

For each chapter as seen in the app preview (e.g. “1.10 Bottle Refusal”, “1.11 Tummy Time & Activity”, etc.), associate all lessons exactly as nested under it.

Lessons must appear in the same order as the UI preview.

Each record should include:

Course → Chapter → Lesson → Lesson Content

Lesson content must match the existing database entry — no content should be guessed or created.

🛡️ Protective Rules (Guardrails):

Do not insert any lesson that does not appear in the approved read-only preview.

Do not apply any bulk logic or inferred matching beyond title-based matching from existing database lessons.

Do not include fallback content or blank matches.

Do not overwrite existing chapters unless they are being correctly updated to match this approved structure.

No duplication of lessons across multiple chapters unless explicitly shown in the read-only view.

✅ Final Output Format (for verification before writing to DB):

Before any database updates are committed:

Present a read-only table for review in the following format:

Chapter Name

Lesson Name

Matched Lesson Title

Matched Content Preview (first 100 characters)

Await manual user approval (via admin confirmation) before finalising write-back to the database.

🧩 Summary Instruction:

Rebuild the full “Big Baby Sleep Course” structure in the database using the visual structure and lessons exactly as displayed in the current read-only UI of the app. Use existing lesson content and do not insert or generate new material. Present a final read-only summary table for manual verification and approval prior to database update.
