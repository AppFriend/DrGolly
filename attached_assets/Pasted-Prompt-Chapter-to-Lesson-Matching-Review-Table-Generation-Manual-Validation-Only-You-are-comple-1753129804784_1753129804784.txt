Prompt: Chapter-to-Lesson Matching & Review Table Generation (Manual Validation Only)
You are completing a scoped matching exercise for Chapter 1.3 Routine to ensure that all lessons are correctly associated with their intended content.

There are known mismatches between database records and frontend displays — however, the correct content is believed to already exist within the system.

This task will produce a read-only, structured table for manual review and approval before any updates are applied to the database.

Objective
Identify and reconcile all lessons that should belong to Chapter 1.3 Routine.

Ensure each lesson is matched to the correct, original authored content, based on a comparison with the approved lesson structure.

Present results in a table for manual validation and approval.

Rules and Requirements
No AI-generated or fallback content is allowed
You must not fabricate, extend, infer or supplement any content. This material has been professionally authored and must remain authentic. Only display content that already exists in the database.

No rewriting or placeholder content
If a lesson match is not found, leave the “Content” column empty and flag as Unmatched.

No database updates during this step
This is a validation and matching task only. Wait for approval before executing updates.

Use the provided examples to guide validation
Two lessons — “Sleep Required by Age” and “Tired Signs” — have been shared to guide the matching process. Use their titles and content structure as reference for correct matches.

Matching Logic
Source all lessons currently tagged or associated with Chapter 1.3 Routine

Compare against the correct lesson structure from the admin UI

Use metadata (titles, slugs, tags) and a content preview (first 100–150 characters) to evaluate correctness

Identify misfiled or orphaned lessons that match by title or theme but are not currently mapped

Flag duplicates, mismatches, and suggested corrections

Output Format (Table)
Present the result in the following format for manual review:

Chapter	Lesson Title	Content Preview (100–150 chars)	Match Status
1.3 Routine	Sleep Required by Age	"The table below is intended to be used as a guide only..."	Correctly Mapped
1.3 Routine	Tired Signs	"Tired signs vary from baby to baby... your baby may exhibit..."	Correctly Mapped
1.3 Routine	Nap Timing	"Understanding when to nap can be tricky, especially..."	Suggested Match
1.3 Routine	Managing Overtiredness	""	Unmatched

All content must be pulled as-is from the database. Do not infer or substitute text.

Scope Protection
Do not modify:

Any non-admin code, user interface, routing, or global styles

Any content in other chapters

The wording of any content

Backend logic, auth, payment, or profile modules

This prompt is strictly limited to validating and preparing a correction for lesson mappings under Chapter 1.3 Routine.
