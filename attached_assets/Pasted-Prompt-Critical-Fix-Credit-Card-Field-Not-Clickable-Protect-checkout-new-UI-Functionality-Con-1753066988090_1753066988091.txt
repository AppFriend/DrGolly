Prompt: Critical Fix – Credit Card Field Not Clickable (Protect checkout-new UI & Functionality)
Context:
The app is built in React for web, using TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Wouter. The new checkout flow (checkout-new) is fully implemented. The visual layout, structure, and all surrounding functionality are now working and approved — and must remain completely untouched.

Objective: Fix Credit Card Input Field Across All Scenarios
Issue:

The credit card input field is currently unclickable and cannot be used to enter card details — this occurs regardless of whether a promo code is used or not.

It blocks users from completing paid transactions and must be fixed immediately.

Requirements
Fix Credit Card Input Behaviour

Make sure the card entry field (likely Stripe or equivalent embed) is always interactive and editable.

This includes:

When no promo code is used

When a partial promo code is applied (discounted)

When a full promo code is applied (free checkout)

Ensure the card field loads correctly, is focusable, and accepts user input across all checkout states.

Preserve All Other Functionality – Do Not Change Anything Else

This fix must not affect:

Any profile creation or login logic

Course loading under “purchases”

Routing post-checkout (user lands on /home)

Any visual layout or CSS structure

Form fields such as name, address, due date, etc.

Do not recompile unrelated components or affect unrelated elements in any way

Console Error Insight (from attached screenshot Screen Shot 2025-07-21 at 12.37.21 pm.png)
401 Unauthorized error on /api/user — this may impact session state; ensure all secure tokens are being passed correctly

Content Security Policy font load violation — not relevant to this issue, but good to isolate

publickey-credentials-get policy violation — may affect permissions if Stripe’s embedded elements are impacted

Summary
Focus purely on fixing the credit card field so it functions in all scenarios

Do not change any other behaviour, styling, logic, layout, routing, or functionality

This fix is for our checkout-new implementation and must be safely scoped to that
