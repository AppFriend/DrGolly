Prompt: Final Fixes and UI Polish for checkout-new (React Web)
Project Scope:
This work applies specifically to our checkout-new experience, built in React (with TypeScript), using Vite, Wouter, Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components, and an Express.js backend. The checkout logic is functioning well and must not be altered.

Critical Fix (Logic Only – Must Be Done First)
When a coupon is applied, credit card fields are currently disabled or unclickable.

This change was not intended and must be reverted. Restore expected functionality so that users can always enter credit card details, even with a 100% discount.

No other checkout logic should be affected. Please confirm:

Payment processing and Stripe flows remain intact.

Course purchases are still recorded.

Existing routing and redirects continue to function as designed.

Only after confirming the logic fix through deep testing, proceed with the following UI changes.

UI Updates (Frontend Only – No Functional Changes)
Header Banner:

Update to use the logo in Screen Shot 2025-07-21 at 12.11.19 pm.png.

Position the logo to the left of the headline text, not above it.

Product Image:

Credit Card Logos:

Replace any existing card icons with the following images:

Visa: Visa_Logo.png

Mastercard: MasterCard_Logo.svg.png

American Express: American_Express_logo_(2018).svg

Ensure uniform sizing and alignment consistent with the current design.

Testimonial Section:

Add smooth carousel functionality to the testimonials section.

Reviews should auto-scroll every 3 seconds.

Keep layout, spacing, and styling consistent — only enable sliding motion.
