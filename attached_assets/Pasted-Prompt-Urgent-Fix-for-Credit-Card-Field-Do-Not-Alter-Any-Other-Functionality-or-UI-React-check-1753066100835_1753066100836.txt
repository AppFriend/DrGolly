Prompt: Urgent Fix for Credit Card Field – Do Not Alter Any Other Functionality or UI (React / checkout-new)
Context:
We are using React for web with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, and Wouter. Our checkout-new experience is now functionally and visually complete — and must be protected exactly as-is.

Objective
Fix the credit card input field, which is currently unclickable/uneditable when a coupon is applied, without modifying or impacting anything else across the checkout flow.

Instructions
Fix Credit Card Input Field (Critical)

When a coupon (e.g. 100 percent discount) is applied, the credit card field becomes non-clickable.

This field must remain editable regardless of coupon value or order total, to ensure consistent checkout behaviour.

Ensure:

The credit card field is always interactive

Stripe (or other payment provider) integration is not broken

All purchase and course activation logic continues working as currently implemented

Do Not Alter Any Other Code

The UI is now signed off. Please preserve it completely — no layout, style or logic changes.

Do not recompile unrelated modules or modify functioning elements, including:

Profile creation

Checkout routing

Course activation under “purchases”

Post-checkout login or redirects

Console Error Log Notes (From Screenshot: Screen Shot 2025-07-21 at 12.37.21 pm.png)
There is a 401 Unauthorized error from /api/user – check that authentication tokens or headers are being passed correctly. This may affect session state or user profile handling.

Font blocked by CSP – unrelated to current issue, no action needed.

Several “Unrecognised feature” warnings – can be ignored unless they directly relate to Stripe or form interactivity.

A publickey-credentials permission warning – can likely be ignored unless tied to card field rendering logic.

These logs suggest the issue may be due to Stripe field interactivity, or a conditionally blocked input caused by current checkout state.

Summary
Fix credit card field so it is always editable

Do not change or impact any other functionality, layout or logic

Use the console logs only to diagnose this specific issue if helpful

Please confirm once this is resolved.
