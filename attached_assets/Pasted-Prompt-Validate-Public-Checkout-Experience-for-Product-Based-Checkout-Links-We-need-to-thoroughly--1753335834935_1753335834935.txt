Prompt: Validate Public Checkout Experience for Product-Based Checkout Links

We need to thoroughly test and confirm that the following user flows, access permissions, and database fields are correctly implemented for the /checkout/:productId pages and associated post-checkout paths.

1. Public Checkout Page Accessibility
Objective: Ensure that any user on the web can access public checkout pages without authentication.

Validate that public URLs such as:

https://dr-golly.replit.app/checkout/6 (Big Baby Sleep Program)

https://dr-golly.replit.app/checkout/5 (Little Baby Sleep Program)

and any other path following the format /checkout/:productId
are publicly accessible without requiring login or authentication.

Test these links in a logged-out session (e.g. incognito mode).

Ensure each page loads with accurate product/course details and a working Stripe payment button.

Note: These pages must not redirect to /login.

2. Flow for New Users (No Existing Profile)
Steps to test:

Access a /checkout/:productId page as a non-authenticated user.

Complete payment successfully.

Confirm automatic redirection to /complete.

Ensure /complete is publicly accessible and prompts the user to:

Enter full name

Set a password

Provide any required preferences and profile information (e.g. children data)

After completing the profile:

User is logged in automatically.

Redirected to /home.

The purchased course appears under Purchased_courses and is visible in their dashboard.

3. Flow for Existing Users (Recognised Email)
Steps to test:

Access a /checkout/:productId page.

Complete checkout using an email that already exists in the database.

Confirm:

Payment is processed.

User is automatically authenticated after checkout (no manual login required).

Redirect to /home.

No /complete step is shown.

New course is added to their existing Purchased_courses record and reflected on the front end.

4. Database Validation
Confirm that each course in the database has a Public_checkout_URL field that maps correctly to its corresponding product ID.

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "course_name": "Big Baby Sleep Program",
  "Public_checkout_URL": "/checkout/6"
}
Validate that this field is:

Present for all live courses

Used to generate the correct public checkout link on marketing pages or referral traffic

Confirm that after checkout:

The correct course ID is saved in the Purchased_courses array for the user

The course ID maps correctly to the actual course in the UI

5. Frontend + Redirect Logic
/home should only be accessible to logged-in users.

/checkout/:productId and /complete must be accessible publicly, with logic determining whether a user is routed to:

/complete for new users

/home for existing users

Ensure the frontend correctly reflects any updates to purchased courses immediately after login or redirection.

Final QA
All edge cases (e.g. duplicate email, payment failure, session expiry) should be tested and logged.

Verify all redirects, authentication checks, and profile creation logic work independently of login status at the time of checkout.

Ensure there is no risk of account duplication if the same email is used by a new user during a public checkout.
