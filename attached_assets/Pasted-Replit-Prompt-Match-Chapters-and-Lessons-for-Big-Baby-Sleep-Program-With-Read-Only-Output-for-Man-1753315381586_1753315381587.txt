Replit Prompt: Match Chapters and Lessons for “Big Baby Sleep Program”
With Read-Only Output for Manual Review Prior to Sync

Objective:
Accurately match all lessons and lesson content to their correct chapters for the Big Baby Sleep Program course. All matches must use real, verified content — no AI-generated or fallback content. The output must be a read-only table for manual human review and approval before applying to any database or app structure.

Input Files:
Chapters.csv
– Contains chapter numbers and names for the Big Baby Sleep Program.
– Includes chapter order and identifiers.

Lessons.csv
– Contains all available lesson titles and their full, doctor-authored content.
– This is the only source of valid lesson content.

Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv
– Contains verified mappings between lesson names and lesson content.
– Use this as the authoritative reference to match lessons to chapters.

(Optional but recommended)
Screenshots of each chapter structure — used to verify correct lesson names per chapter and avoid over-matching.

Matching Logic:
For each chapter listed in Chapters.csv under the Big Baby Sleep Program:

Extract the expected lesson names (from screenshots or chapter structure).

Look up each lesson in Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv.

Retrieve the corresponding lesson content from Lessons.csv.

Ensure exact match of lesson title and use the real, full content.

Matching must be strict and traceable:

Lesson names must be verified from screenshots or the reference CSV — not loosely interpreted.

Lesson content must come exclusively from Lessons.csv.

Chapter and lesson names should follow the format in the app (e.g. 1.3 Routine, Routine 6–8 Months).

Guardrails:
Do not generate or insert any new, AI-generated, fallback or inferred lesson content.

Do not use lesson name similarity or fuzzy matching unless explicitly verified.

Only include lessons that have a direct and approved match in the reference CSV or screenshots.

Do not duplicate any lesson inside a chapter.

Flag unmatched or questionable lessons with UNMATCHED in the output for manual check.

Output Requirements (Read-Only Table for QA):
Before any database update is made, return a preview table with the following structure for human approval:

Chapter Name	Lesson Name (in course)	Matched Lesson Title (from CSV)	Matched Lesson Content (from CSV)

The table must contain all lessons in order for each chapter of the Big Baby Sleep Program.

Leave unmatched entries blank or flag with UNMATCHED.

Do not proceed to sync content until the human reviewer manually confirms accuracy.

QA Checks (Required Before Approval):
Lesson names exactly match those shown in screenshots or chapter references.

Content is pulled verbatim from Lessons.csv, not edited or summarised.

No duplicated or extraneous lessons in any chapter.

No unmatched or placeholder content is present.

Optional Enhancements:
If screenshots are provided, use OCR or image parsing to cross-check lesson names against chapter structure before matching.

Allow user to upload a new version of the final CSV as reference for future sync cycles.
