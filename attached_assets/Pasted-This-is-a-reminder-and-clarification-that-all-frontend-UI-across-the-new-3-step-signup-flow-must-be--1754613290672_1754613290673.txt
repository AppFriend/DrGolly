This is a reminder and clarification that all frontend UI across the new 3-step signup flow must be designed to match the attached screenshots and described specifications — not approximate versions or interpretations.

The goal is to create a world-class, frictionless signup experience, so design precision matters.

📌 GENERAL RULES (ALL STEPS)
Use modern responsive layout with:

Clean padding/margin spacing

Mobile-first responsiveness

Full desktop scaling

All text, buttons, forms, backgrounds, and structure must reflect the provided design references

All UI elements must be accessible, properly labelled, and usable with keyboard navigation

Use consistent fonts, weights, and styles already in the app design system (or as per screenshots)

🔹 STEP 1 — /signup
Reference: signup design reference.png

✅ Must include:
Green cloud design as background and page frame

Google Sign-In button styled and functional

Fields:

Email

Password

Confirm Password

✅ Pre-checked checkbox:
"By opting in, you agree to receive marketing materials."

✅ Consent statement below form:
"By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service" → Link to /terms

CTA button: "Sign Up" styled exactly as shown (mint/teal with rounded corners)

🔄 Logic:
On submit, proceed to /createprofile

Persist user profile in DB at this step (even if steps 2 or 3 are skipped)

🔹 STEP 2 — /createprofile
Reference: Profile.png

✅ Must include (in order):
First Name

Last Name

Phone Number with Country Selector Dropdown (required format)

Profile Picture upload (optional) with clickable “Add a Profile Picture”

Role selection pills:

Parent

Grandparent

Carer

✅ Selected pill must show clearly (e.g. coloured border or fill)

✅ Checkbox Section:
"By signing up you agree to the Dr Golly Terms of Service" → Link to /terms

"By opting in, you agree to receive marketing materials." (pre-unchecked)

✅ “Continue” CTA button styled same as Sign Up button (rounded, teal)

🔄 Logic:
On submit, update user profile in DB and move to /preferences

🔹 STEP 3 — /preferences
Reference: Preferences.png

✅ Must include:
Heading: "Where can we help you first?"

Subheading: "You can select multiple & we'll personalise your experience!"

Four large selectable visual cards:

Baby Sleep

Toddler Sleep

Toddler Behaviour

Partner Discounts

✅ Cards should:

Be selectable with visual change (e.g. outline, fill, or icon toggle)

Allow multi-select

CTA button: “Continue” at bottom (same style as other steps)

🔄 Logic:
Store preferences as array in user profile

If Step 1 + 2 are also complete, set profile_complete = true

⚠️ DO NOT IGNORE:
Match the layout, font sizes, button shapes, and spacing exactly as in screenshots

Do not collapse fields or re-order elements unless absolutely necessary for responsiveness

DO NOT skip UI elements like checkboxes, pills, buttons or headings — all are essential for UX, segmentation, or compliance

✅ SUMMARY OF FILE REFERENCES
Step	Screenshot	Key Visual Requirements
/signup	signup design reference.png	Green cloud background, Google login, styled CTA, consent
/createprofile	Profile.png	Full-name + phone + role selection pills, checkboxes
/preferences	Preferences.png	4 selectable cards, subheading, consistent CTA
