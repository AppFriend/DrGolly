Update Big Baby Course from Master Spreadsheet
Purpose:
Update the Big Baby Course structure by adding Chapters, Lesson Names, and Lesson Content starting from row 70 onward, using the uploaded spreadsheet as the single source of truth.

Guardrails and Requirements
Do not alter or regenerate any existing content already in rows 1–69. These are already correct and must remain untouched.

Do not generate any new, placeholder, or fallback content using AI. Only use what exists in the uploaded spreadsheet.

Only match and insert data found in the source spreadsheet:
Big BABY - Master Sheet - Updated_Chapter-Lesson_Matching.csv

Lesson content must be matched exactly to its corresponding Chapter and Lesson Name. This includes correct formatting, punctuation, and paragraph breaks.

Ensure no duplication, mislabeling, or skipping of any chapter or lesson.

If any chapter or lesson listed in the spreadsheet cannot be matched in the course structure, flag it and pause execution for human review.

Course Structure Format
The course should maintain the following schema:

Chapter	Lesson Name	Lesson Content
1.10 Bottle Refusal	Introducing Bottles – A How to Guide	[AUTHENTIC CONTENT ONLY]
1.11 Tummy Time & Activity	Tummy Time Positions	[AUTHENTIC CONTENT ONLY]
...	...	...
Evidence Based Clinical Research	Research for Those Who Want to Dig Deeper	[AUTHENTIC CONTENT ONLY]

All of the above should be directly imported from the spreadsheet rows 70 onward.

Implementation Steps
Open the file: Big BABY - Master Sheet - Updated_Chapter-Lesson_Matching.csv

Loop through rows 70 onward:

Extract values from the Chapter, Lesson Name, and Lesson Content columns.

For each row:

Add new Lesson under the correct Chapter.

Ensure the full lesson content is inserted without formatting loss.

Validate that each chapter and lesson in the spreadsheet appears in the final course structure.

Do not modify any rows outside of this range.

Summary
This prompt ensures the Big Baby Course is updated with validated content from the official spreadsheet, without risking content integrity or introducing AI-generated text. The entire update begins at row 70, and the spreadsheet remains the single source of truth.
