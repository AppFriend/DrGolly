We are actively testing the /checkout/:id public checkout flow via our Replit app at:
🔗 https://dr-golly.replit.app/checkout/6

🛠️ GOAL:
To update and clean up the user experience of the public checkout flow without impacting any existing checkout or payment functionality. Stripe integration is working perfectly, and must not be changed.

✅ Current Checkout Setup
Each course has a dedicated URL endpoint (e.g. /checkout/6 for Big Baby Sleep Program).

These URLs are mapped directly to Stripe products (see attached screenshot of all /checkout/:id endpoints).

Our long-term plan is to replace WooCommerce Buy Now buttons with these Replit-hosted URLs.

Discount coupons work perfectly (e.g. App_Checkout-Test$1), and total calculation is accurate.

🧪 Testing Link
Example being tested:
https://dr-golly.replit.app/checkout/6 → Big Baby Sleep Program

⚠️ REQUIREMENTS
1. 🔐 User Flow – Logic per user type
For new users:

After payment, redirect to the /complete page.

On the /complete page, the user should be able to:

Set their password

See confirmation their account has been created

Be automatically logged in

Be taken straight into their purchased course (e.g. Big Baby Sleep Program)

The course must be saved as a “purchased course” in the customer’s record in the database.

For existing users:

When their email is recognised at checkout:

After payment, they should be auto-logged in

The new course must be added to their existing account and course history in the database

Then redirect them to the course dashboard

🎯 UX/UI FIXES TO IMPLEMENT
Date field placeholder

Replace existing text with:
Date of Birth / Baby Due Date

/complete page logic

Currently showing a login form which confuses new users.

Fix logic so it:

Detects if the user is new → shows "Set Password" form

Confirms account creation

Logs user in immediately after setting password

Redirects to their dashboard with purchased course visible

Debug display

Remove this debug message from the UI:
Debug: Direct Purchase - Cart items: 0, Course ID: 6, Course loaded: false

This should only be visible to devs (e.g. behind auth or in console if needed).

🧼 Non-Negotiables
⚠️ DO NOT CHANGE ANY CORE PAYMENT FUNCTIONALITY

The checkout is already working well, including course mapping and Stripe.

Changes should be purely frontend improvements and login logic updates as described above.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
✅ Coupon codes still work

✅ Stripe checkout remains fully operational

✅ Each product maps correctly via /checkout/:id

✅ Course is recorded in user’s database record post-purchase

✅ New user flow: checkout → /complete → set password → logged in → course dashboard

✅ Existing user flow: checkout → logged in → course dashboard

✅ UX bugs resolved (placeholder + debug message removed)
