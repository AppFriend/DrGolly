We are using Replit for a web app where admins can log in and manage course content via a dedicated admin panel. Course data is stored in a structured format across three fields in the database:

Chapter

Lesson

LessonContent

Each admin update is meant to automatically update the database (our single source of truth) in real-time upon save.

📌 INCIDENT SUMMARY

On Thursday 31st August at 10:30AM AEST, a registered admin user (alex@drgolly.com) successfully logged in and made numerous updates to the course content.

These changes were confirmed as saved at the time.

However, today (Monday 5th August), upon logging in again, Alex found all course content reverted, missing her updates from the 31st August session.

No other admin users have made changes since, and no app deployments or schema updates were made.

✅ OBJECTIVES
🕵️‍♂️ Investigate & Recover

Review project/database backups, logs, or version control to restore all course content (Chapters, Lessons, LessonContent) as it existed at or just after 10:30AM AEST on Thursday 31st August.

If timestamped change logs or audit trails exist, trace the last known good state for alex@drgolly.com and restore it.

🐛 Debug Why Changes Were Lost

Identify why Alex’s changes did not persist. Possible areas to investigate:

Was the DB write operation triggered correctly after admin panel save?

Was the correct DB write method used (e.g., atomic update or transactional)?

Any overwrite, rollback, or deployment that could have reverted content?

Any error handling suppressing save failures without alert?

🛠 Implement Robust Saving Logic

Ensure all future admin updates to Chapters, Lessons, and LessonContent:

Trigger a reliable write to the database

Return confirmation to the UI that changes are saved

Include error handling and retry logic if save fails

Optionally store a versioned change history (audit trail) per content item for rollback/debugging

🧪 Add Confirmation & Safeguards

On each save:

Confirm DB update succeeded and notify admin user

Log changes with timestamp and user

Provide user feedback if save fails (e.g., toast message or modal)

🧾 REQUESTED REPORTING
Please include a comprehensive report that documents:

What content was found and restored (with timestamps)

What likely caused the data loss

What code/config changes were made to:

Fix the issue

Prevent future recurrence

Confirmation of successful testing for:

Admin updates being saved

DB changes being retained across sessions

Recovery logic where applicable

🔐 CRITICAL: DO NOT
Modify or delete any user data without backup

Rollback the entire database unless scoped to course content only

Overwrite live data without first presenting a version diff or backup
