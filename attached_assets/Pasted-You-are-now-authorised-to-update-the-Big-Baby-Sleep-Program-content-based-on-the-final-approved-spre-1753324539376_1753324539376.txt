You are now authorised to update the Big Baby Sleep Program content based on the final approved spreadsheet:
Final_Chapter_Lesson_Matches_Refined.csv

Scope & Objective
Your task is to update the lesson content only, for the Big Baby Sleep Program, based on the approved spreadsheet.

However, no data should be written or changed unless the chapter and lesson structure exactly matches the read-only structure currently visible in the app. This ensures structural alignment with what has been manually reviewed and approved.

Guardrails
Do not generate or modify any content yourself.

All content must come from the Matched Content column in the provided CSV.

No fallback, placeholder, or AI-generated text is permitted.

Do not make any structural changes.

Do not create new lessons or chapters.

Do not rename or reorder anything.

You are only updating the content field of lessons that already exist.

Match only if structure is verified.

Before updating a lesson, confirm:

The chapter name exactly matches a chapter in the app.

The lesson name exactly matches a lesson within that chapter.

The structure must match what is visible in the app’s read-only view that has been reviewed and approved.

How to Match & Update
Use this process for every row in the CSV:

CSV Field	Usage
Chapter Name	Match to an existing chapter under “Big Baby Sleep Program”
Lesson Name	Match to an existing lesson under that chapter
Matched Content	Replace the current lesson content with this field

Read the CSV into memory.

For each row:

Verify the chapter exists and is correctly named.

Verify the lesson exists within the correct chapter.

If both match the approved read-only structure:

Update the content field of that lesson with Matched Content.

If either chapter or lesson name does not match:

Skip the update and log the row for manual review.

Do not change:

Lesson or chapter order

Lesson or chapter names

Any metadata or relationships between chapters, lessons, or courses

Database Write Requirements
Use safe update methods (e.g. wrapped in transactions or staged writes).

Maintain the following database structure:

css
Copy
Edit
Course → Chapter → Lesson → Lesson Content
Write only to the lesson content field.

Log every update with:

Course name

Chapter name

Lesson name

Timestamp

Confirmation that structure matched

Output Requirements
At the end of the update process, return a confirmation report that includes:

Total lessons matched and updated

Total skipped due to mismatch with approved app structure

Clear log of any mismatches

Approval Context
The app’s course structure has been reviewed and approved via a read-only UI preview by the content owner. This prompt assumes structural approval has been confirmed. The update should now safely sync content only, using the CSV as the authoritative source of truth.
