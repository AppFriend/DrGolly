You are updating the existing Little Baby Course content in the app database. All data must be sourced exclusively and exactly from the provided spreadsheet titled:

Little BABY - Master Sheet - Updated_Chapter-Lesson_Matching (3) (1).csv

OBJECTIVE:
Update the course content in the app so that it exactly matches the structure and data in the spreadsheet. This includes:

Chapter Name

Lesson Name

Lesson Content

HOW TO MATCH AND UPDATE:
Data Matching:

Match lessons in the app's Little Baby Course using a strict combination of:

Chapter Name (Column A)

Lesson Name (Column B)

These must match exactly with the chapter and lesson names in the spreadsheet.

The Lesson Content (Column C) from the CSV should be used to update the matched lesson.

Update Logic:

For every row in the spreadsheet:

If a Chapter + Lesson Name match is found in the app's database:

Replace the current lesson content with the exact content from Column C.

If a Chapter or Lesson does not exist in the current app database:

Flag the unmatched entry and pause the update process

Do not create new content or auto-correct names — instead, log the row and wait for manual approval.

Guardrails & Protections:

No AI-generated, fallback or placeholder content is allowed.

Do not alter lesson titles or chapter names under any circumstances.

Only apply changes where a direct match is found. If no match exists, skip the update and log the issue.

Database Field Mapping:

App database structure:

Course Name: "Little Baby Course"

Chapter: maps to Chapter Name from CSV

Lesson: maps to Lesson Name from CSV

Lesson Content: updated using Lesson Content from CSV

Data Source Confirmation:

All Lesson Content must be sourced exactly as written from the provided file.

No reformatting or enrichment allowed — maintain the raw structure.

Final Check:

Once all matches are processed:

Generate a confirmation log showing:

Successfully updated lessons

Skipped rows due to unmatched chapters or lessons

Share a read-only table of proposed updates before final database write, if possible
