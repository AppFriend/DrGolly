1.6 Sleep Props,Dummies and Comforters,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Your baby is old enough now to really enjoy having a comforter +/- a dummy. If you haven’t done so already, introduce a comforter that will provide your baby with something to become attached to and see as a positive sleep cue.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Pop the comforter down your top every so often so it takes on your smell, and leave it in your baby’s cot.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby takes a dummy, then choosing a comforter that you can attach multiple dummies to is important. Once past 6 months, I don’t recommend ditching the dummy until closer to 2.5-3 years old as it becomes too hard and not worth the battle.</span></p>"
1.6 Sleep Props,Finding and Replacing their Own Dummy,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">You can begin to teach your baby to find and replace their own dummy from 6 months old. Now that your baby is between 8-12 months old, they are very capable of learning to do this independently.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Finding and replacing their own dummy begins with showing them how to pick it up themselves and pop it in their own mouth the right way. Make it into a game during the day and let them have lots of practice.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 1: During awake time, place your baby's hand onto their dummy.<br>Step 2: Help them pick it up with their hand.</strong></span><strong><br></strong><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Step 3: Guide it to their mouth with them.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The sooner they are able to find and replace their own dummy, the quicker they will be able to self-soothe when they wake from a nap or overnight, and at 8-12 months old they are definitely able to do this themselves.</span></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Nutrition,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Your baby should now be progressing well with solids, and if you have any concerns, please speak to your GP or pediatrician. By now, your baby should be on 3 meals per day and sometimes a snack as well.</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Always offer meals at least 1 hour before nap or bedtime as we don’t want your baby going to bed uncomfortable on a full tummy.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Ensure you’re offering cooled, boiled water at meal times in a sippy cup or straw cup.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">As your baby approaches 9 months of age, they may show interest in dropping the post-lunchtime milk feed. If this is the case, then it should be replaced with some afternoon tea.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This stage becomes more about the food than the breast milk/formula. It is important to make sure that babies are progressing with more complex textures of foods and being given many opportunities to try a range of textures. The consistency should be more mashed and chunky now, as well as some baby-led feeding encouraged.</li></ul><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><p><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/03b/84f/92b/shutterstock_1677882433.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1677882433.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></p></figure></div><p><br></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,The Importance of Protein,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Your baby should now be having protein at lunchtime and dinner, which will help stabilize their blood sugars overnight and help reduce night wake-ups.25-50g of a protein source should be added. These include foods like chicken, turkey, red meats, fish, egg, and dairy. Beans, legumes, and tofu are a great source of protein and can now be introduced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Protein can also be offered at dinnertime now; however, if your baby starts waking frequently overnight, then take a step back from the protein at dinnertime for a couple of weeks, then reintroduce it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>GENERAL NOTE:</strong><br><em>I'm deliberate in the <strong>25-50g of protein</strong> measurement—I don't want parents googling micronutrients of protein sources—it's a general guide to make protein-rich meals.</em></span></p><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/a27/a72/05d/shutterstock_571277590.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_571277590.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" origin-size=""1000,667"" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.7 Nutrition,Including Your Baby at Family Meal Times,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Offering your baby what the rest of the family is eating is absolutely essential as your baby gets older. I discourage people from looking at <em>‘baby cookbooks’</em> as a version of a family meal is always best (<em>before any salt or chili is added to it</em>). I suggest that by 12 months of age, your baby will be eating family meals, and the only way to introduce them to those foods is to let them try them (<em>again, slightly modified so as not to have salt or chili</em>).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tip: If you aren’t eating your main meal when your baby does at 5 PM, then it can be helpful to make a bit extra for your baby for the next night and heat it up for them. This will ensure they are still getting variety and eating what you are, plus it means you don’t have to cook anything special just for them.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><p><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/ef5/803/67a/shutterstock_1157940622.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1157940622.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></p></figure></div>"
1.7 Nutrition,Avoiding a Food/Milk Imbalance,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A food/milk imbalance can occur when your baby has large milk feeds or excessive milk feeds and is then no longer hungry enough to take solids.&nbsp;Our suggested routines take this into account and will give you a guide as to what is the best time and order to offer milk feeds and solids.&nbsp;At this age breastmilk/formula is still your baby’s primary source of nutrition however we also want them to be hungry enough to take an interest in solids and have a wide variety of flavours and textures.</span></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Reverse Cycling,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Reverse cycling</strong> occurs when a baby is having a large amount of calories overnight, which then impacts their hunger and calories consumed during the day. At this age, we want your baby to be consuming most of their calories during the day from both solids and breastmilk or formula feeds.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Reducing the amount of feeds overnight they're having can significantly increase their daytime calories and is another thing that will help them sleep more soundly both day and night. A key indicator that your baby is having too many calories overnight is if they wake at 6:30-7 AM and aren't interested in their milk feed or breakfast.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">See our Dropping Night Feeds video in <em>Chapter 1.2 - Routine</em> on how to reduce and eliminate your baby's overnight feeds.</span></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Tryptophan and Sleep,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Foods high in tryptophan content can help promote sleep as they release neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin, which are our sleep hormones.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that serves several important purposes, like nitrogen balance in adults and growth in infants. It also creates niacin, which is essential in creating the neurotransmitter serotonin. This is converted to melatonin in the presence of darkness. Melatonin is our sleep hormone, so a healthy production of this is important.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Foods high in tryptophan include turkey, chicken, bananas, oats, kidney beans, dairy, and eggs.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Note - these don’t have to specifically be eaten at night to promote sleep, they can be enjoyed all throughout the day.</em></span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/d74/ec1/12b/shutterstock_1173806725_%281%29.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1173806725_%281%29.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div><p><br></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Packet Food and Pouches,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Packet/pouch food is amazingly convenient - it’s affordable, sterile, mobile. It’s absolutely OK to use packet food. They are perfect for food on the run.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">In order to achieve 12 hours of overnight sleep, I recommend 25-50g of a protein source at lunch.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>When it comes to packet food and pouches I always recommend you:</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>1. Read the label.</strong><br>There's often a lot of sugar (even if they are natural sugars, they are still sugar). What looks like vegetables could be 50% apple. Remember, our babies need to learn to eat a variety of flavors, and introducing one flavor/food at a time is important. We are also yet to find a pouch that has enough protein for this lunchtime feed. If you find one, tell us!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>2. Never let a baby eat straight from the pouch.</strong><br>Spoon feeding utilizes mouth muscles necessary for healthy growth and development. Additionally, toddlers can learn how to use a spoon to build fine motor skills. I always recommend using a spoon when feeding these purees. I'm not alarmist here - it's ok for toddlers to 'suck' on these pouches <em>occasionally (we've all forgotten a spoon on the run!).</em> However, make sure before they do this, they have started spoon-feeding themselves, eating finger foods, and drinking from a cup with minimal spilling before giving them to 'suck' on a pouch.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>3. Ensure texture is introduced as your baby grows.</strong><br>When food texture does not progress with the development of your baby, they are not challenged to learn how to chew. Studies have found that babies who were introduced to lumpy solids after the age of nine months ate less of the food groups at seven years old than those introduced between six and nine months old. The good news is there are now lots of baby packet foods and pouches with texture!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>4. Don't depend on pouches for their only source of fruit and veg.</strong><br>Packets and pouches shouldn't be the sole source of your baby's fruits and veggies. We want kids to accept fruits and vegetables in a variety of formats and textures! This is why the process of offering puree (to eat easily via the spoon), mash (to build texture and play with), and some soft finger food of the same ingredient when we introduce foods is so important.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Again, as we approach the starting of solids, my philosophy is to make food fun for both parents and babies - embrace the mess.</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When you're out and about, you may not want your baby covered head to toe in what they are eating - and that's absolutely fine. Use packets and pouches when you need to, but make sure your baby is getting a variety of flavors and age-appropriate textures as they develop.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Even when you're using packets, you can still give them handheld food. There are some great dissolvable vegetable sticks that can be terrific when you're still having fun but want to minimize the mess when you're out and about!</span></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Calcium,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">My goal by 12 months is that children have a range of foods from each core food group to meet nutritional requirements as their milk intake declines.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It is not necessary for children to drink cow’s milk at 12 months of age. They are able to meet their calcium requirements in other ways.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Calcium requirements at 12 months of age are 500mg/day, and this could be achieved through 2 good servings of yoghurt and cheese, or alternate dairy-free options too if this is required.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><p><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/e07/63b/446/shutterstock_149795786.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_149795786.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></p></figure></div>"
1.7 Nutrition,Constipation and Bowel Movements During Sleep Time,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By 6 months of age, most children will have stopped opening their bowels overnight, however, if your baby is still having a bowel motion overnight, then try adjusting when you offer your baby fruit as sometimes this can help.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">For example, if your baby has fruit after dinner, then try giving it at breakfast time instead.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If a child has 1-3 bowel movements per day at this age group, then this is considered to be normal, assuming the actual bowel movement is also a normal soft stool.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is constipated, then offering high-fibre foods and foods such as prunes, diluted prune juice, or pears can be helpful. If it continues, please speak with your doctor.</span></p><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none"" style=""width: 30%""><figure style=""width: 100%;""><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/dcf/ce0/ee3/shutterstock_1735911233.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size=""30%,auto"" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""30%,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1735911233.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" origin-size=""1000,668"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto;""></figure></div><p><br></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Introducing Allergens,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>A note before you start reading.&nbsp;</strong>As we learned in the starting solids video &amp; content - starting solids should be a fun process that both parents and babies enjoy.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The aim of the following two chapters:</strong></span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Introducing allergens</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Identifying allergic reactions</li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Is to:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Empower you as parents</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Utilize the latest research and findings to guide you on the best approach to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Understand if you’re in a potentially higher risk category</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Know how to identify an allergic reaction</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Know what to do next if your baby does show signs of a reaction</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">These chapters are not meant to make you fearful of starting solids and<strong>I definitely don’t want to over-medicalize the introduction of solids.</strong>Remember there’s a 90% chance there will be absolutely no problem whatsoever.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">With that said…</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Allergies are on the rise:</strong><br>Food allergies are on the rise in developed countries, with significant public health impact. Serious allergy (anaphylaxis) can greatly hinder the quality of life for both children and parents.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>What are the most common allergens?</strong><br><strong>The 4 most common dietary allergies are to:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Cow’s milk</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Egg</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Peanut</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Tree nuts including cashew, walnut, and pistachio</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>The next 5 in the cohort are still common compared to other food groups but far less so than the top 4, these are:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Fish</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Shellfish</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Wheat</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Soy</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Sesame</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Most children will outgrow allergies to egg, milk, soy, and wheat - but it’s less likely they’ll grow out of allergies to nuts and seafood - though these may decrease in severity over time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Common Allergens Image:</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/48a/387/79f/DrG_-_Common_Allergens_posts_%28still%29.png"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""DrG_-_Common_Allergens_posts_%28still%29.png"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" origin-size=""1080,1080"" style=""""></figure></div><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>When should I introduce allergens?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Advice from ASCIA (the allergy governing body) recommends introducing complementary foods (including allergens) in the window of 4-6 months.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Introducing allergens in the 4-6 month window is associated with the lowest incidence of allergy for children.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Between 4-6 months, single-ingredient infant foods may be introduced, typically including fruits (apples, pears, and bananas), vegetables (green vegetables, sweet potatoes, squash, and carrots), and cereal grains (rice or oat cereal) one at a time.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Food can be introduced this way every 3 to 5 days as appropriate for the infant’s developmental readiness.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This slow process of introducing new foods and allergens one at a time gives parents or caregivers a chance to identify and eliminate any food that causes an allergic reaction.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Egg, dairy, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, and wheat can be gradually introduced during the same four to six-month window after less allergenic foods have been tolerated.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">While the 4-6 month window is preferable, don’t stress if you don’t get them all in by 6 months to the day - all allergens should be introduced before your baby turns 12 months.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Never rub food on your baby's skin:</strong><br>Never rub food on your baby’s skin, especially in babies with eczema, as this may increase the chance of your baby developing a food allergy. Always wash your hands after eating if your baby has eczema. Effective eczema management is one of the key ways we can reduce food allergies, so if your baby is suffering, seek help and treatment immediately.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Don't delay allergen introduction:</strong><br>Delaying the introduction of these foods may increase your baby’s risk of developing allergies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Honey should be avoided until 12 months of age:</strong><br>Not for reasons of allergy, but due to the possibility of contamination with botulinum toxin - botox, which can be found in honey.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>How to introduce allergens:</strong></span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’ve chosen peanuts to focus on, for example - get some smooth peanut butter and have your child lick it off your finger or a small spoon. For allergen exposure, they don’t need to swallow and ingest the food - they only need to have it in and around their mouth. Even if they spit it out - consider this enough of an exposure.<br><strong>TIP:</strong> Make sure you’re not exposing them right before bed - because you want to have an eye on them to note any potential allergic reactions.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Repeat this exposure for a further 2 days.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Once 3 exposures have been successful, you can then intermittently incorporate that food into your baby’s diet and be reassured.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Then move on to the next allergen on your list. </li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">​<strong>Once you have tested an allergen, keep it in their diet:</strong><br><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once you have fed your baby the common allergy-causing foods, it is important to continue to include these foods in your baby’s meals at least twice a week.&nbsp;</span><em><span style=""color: rgb(31, 56, 68)"">Trying a food and then not giving it regularly may result in a food allergy developing.</span></em>​</li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>A note to all families:</strong><br>If you have a high-risk baby, it might be beneficial to work through allergy introduction more systematically.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>What babies are considered at high risk of allergic reaction?</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">A family history of food allergies</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Atopic eczema</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Already allergic to one or more foods</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Parents born in Asia</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>For high-risk babies, the following process is recommended for introducing allergens:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Day 1:</strong> Swab on lip, wait 10 mins, followed by 1/8 teaspoon</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Day 2:</strong> 1/4 teaspoon</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Day 3:</strong> 1/2 teaspoon</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Day 4:</strong> 3/4 teaspoon</li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Day 5:</strong> Full teaspoon</li></ul><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""color: rgb(31, 56, 68)""><br></span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Should breastfeeding mothers restrict allergens?</strong><br>There is no evidence that restricting or increasing the intake of certain foods in a breastfeeding mother’s diet will have any impact on the child.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The next section will focus on identifying and how to act if you think your baby has had an allergic reaction to a certain food.</span></p>"
1.7 Nutrition,Identifying Allergic Reactions,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Allergic reactions usually occur quickly - within minutes (although they can take up to 2 hours). Other reactions to foods may be delayed.

1.7 Nutrition,FAQs - Nutrition,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Why does offering breakfast solids before milk help with early morning waking?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">ANS: Babies over time can learn to wake for milk as this is their primary source of nutrition until around 6 months of age. With early morning waking, babies have a strong desire for a milk feed and can wake in anticipation.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">By offering breakfast solids first (i.e., around 6:30/7 AM), it takes this anticipation away and therefore encourages a later wake-up. Babies still receive both solids and milk, so nothing changes nutritionally, just the order in which they're offered.</span></p>"
1.8 Development,Crawling & Walking,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Most babies are on the move during this age bracket. This may involve crawling, shuffling, walking assisted, or even walking independently. Babies can exercise enormous amounts, just by dancing all four limbs or by pulling to stand and cruising along furniture.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">All physical activity should be encouraged, as well as playing with toys, rolling balls to-and-fro, and dancing along to music. The more physically active your child is during their playtime, the deeper their sleep is likely to become. Swimming is an excellent example of physically tiring.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Sleep can often be disrupted due to babies wanting to practice their new skills. Learning to crawl or walk marks a huge developmental progression, however, the good news is that it usually only lasts a couple of weeks. The best thing to do, as always, is to stay consistent with your approach. If your baby wakes during a nap or overnight and they are happy practicing their new skill such as crawling in the cot, there is no need to intervene until they begin to get upset or frustrated.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/87a/574/743/shutterstock_457769221.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_457769221.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" origin-size=""8763,4489"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.8 Development,Weight,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">I’ve seen thousands of babies over the years, brought to me due to concerns about dropping weight centiles. It’s a very necessary thing to be reviewed by a doctor, because dropping weight centiles - and even more concerning, dropping weight - can be a sign of poor growth and possible underlying problems.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s very distressing for parents, but it’s important to know that it can also be a very normal phenomenon. Many babies might be putting on weight adequately, but dropping centiles from a birth centile - for example, 40th - to a 6-week centile of 25th. Very often, this is what I refer to as a weight correction (see section on weight correction in 2.0 Little Baby).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When in utero, the baby’s weight is determined by the function of the placenta, adequate intake through the umbilical cord and the mother’s blood sugar levels. Babies can sometimes be born larger - or smaller - than expected. But once the baby is born, that sugar supply drops and they’re more able to regulate their calorie intake, they are bound to drop their weight centile accordingly. Similarly, babies born smaller due to a poorly functioning placenta or umbilical cord will often display excellent ‘catch-up’ growth and increase centiles accordingly.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The point is that there are many factors at play that determine the birth-weight of a baby and therefore the initial centile. But that may not be the ‘genetically predetermined’ (or likely) centile that baby was always going to be on. As they achieve a ‘correction’ in their weight centiles, we often see them gaining weight - but dropping centiles. Once reviewed by a doctor, you can trust that this is ok and not a cause for concern in most babies.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once the weight correction is complete, babies tend to oscillate around a certain centile but generally continue to grow quite consistently. If we watch their centiles too closely however, usually by measuring weight too frequently, babies often appear to be reaching a plateau or dropping centiles again.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Serial (frequent, regular) weight measurements can often induce much anxiety. Once the baby has realised their ‘genetic centile’ then they often shift between 10 centile points above/below this over time. This is because babies go through periods of ‘rapid growth’ (less interest in food, smaller volumes consumed, more sleep, marked increase in length, weight plateau) and periods of ‘energy storage’ (high food intake, increase weight, less sleep). Babies grow like an accordion - first they grow ‘out’ and then they grow ‘up’ - once we understand this, we do not stress about a week of poor weight gain, because we trust that next week’s will likely be far better.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Also take into consideration your baby’s energy intake and output. A baby who has just learned to crawl, for example, might be moving more than ever, expending a huge amount of energy and this might explain a brief drop on the centile chart.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you have noticed a significant centile drop or multiple centile reductions over many weeks, have your child reviewed by a doctor.</span></p>"
1.8 Development,Standing in the Cot,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">At around 8-11 months old, babies will learn to stand. This is a fantastic and exciting skill for them to learn, and they'll usually want to practise it at sleep time too. When babies learn to stand, it can be a <em>very</em> tricky time when it comes to sleep, and there is often a disruption due to this developmental progression. This is because they usually learn how to stand before learning how to get themselves back down.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">However, you can be rest assured that babies eventually learn how to get back down from standing and be able to self-settle if they have previously been able to do this.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIPS FOR BABIES STANDING IN THE COT</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>USING YOUR SETTLING TECHNIQUE DURING THIS TIME</strong><br>If your baby is standing in the cot and physically unable to get down independently yet, then they're going to need your help. If using an in-room settling technique, then simply lie or sit your baby back down and remain sitting with them as you usually would. If they immediately get straight back up, continue sitting them down, but you might want to wait 30-60 seconds until putting them down again so it doesn't become a game.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you're using an out-of-room technique such as spaced soothing, then I recommend going into them and sitting or lying them back down within a couple of minutes of them standing.

1.8 Development,Tired Signs,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Tired signs vary from baby to baby, and it’s very normal to still be getting to know and recognise your baby’s tired signs at this age. You will generally start to see them towards the end of the suggested awake time. As your baby gets older, these tired signs may become less noticeable and less reliable. For example, as adults, we often yawn when we get out of bed in the morning, but this does not necessarily mean we are ready to go back to bed for more sleep. If your baby’s tired signs are harder to read now, then focus more on their awake time and suggested routine for their age. Your baby, however, may still exhibit the tired signs below.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><br></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><div><strong>I'm Getting Tired</strong><br></div></td><td><div><strong>I'm Ready for Bed</strong></div></td><td><div><strong>I'm Overtired</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Distant looks/stares<br></div></td><td><div>Yawning</div></td><td><div>Hysterical Crying</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Appearing bored</div></td><td><div>Eye rubbing</div></td><td><div>Arching back</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>More vocal/chatting</div></td><td><div>Pulling hair/ears</div></td><td><div>Stiff body</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Red eyebrows/eyelids</div></td><td><div>Wanting to suck and appearing</div><div>hungry</div></td><td><div>Very difficult to settle</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Starts posseting/spilling milk more</div><div>despite not being fed for some time</div></td><td><div>Making fists with hand</div><div><br></div></td><td><div><br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Jerky movements</div></td><td><div>Grizzling</div></td><td><div>​</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
1.9 Teething,Teething in Pre Toddlers,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Although babies seem to ‘grow out of teething,’ it should not be forgotten that teething continues throughout infancy. 1-year-olds will often erupt their first molars and can have an unsettled period. This can recur intermittently through to over 3 years of age.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Teething isn’t considered an illness, so it is completely fine to continue sleep training if you see some teeth coming through, as long as your baby is comfortable. However, don't underestimate the pain teething may cause and look to treat it as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>There are plenty of remedies to try to help your baby through this sometimes painful process including:</em></strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">teething gels</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">pain relief medication</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">teething rings</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">one of my favourites is a clean washcloth soaked in breastmilk &amp; frozen - use an elastic band to create &amp; secure a ""ball"" so they have something to suck on and something to hang onto</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Teething should be considered a 24-hour process, so if your baby is miserable and showing signs of teething pain during the day, offer some pain relief before bed at night and provide extra comfort.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/1ec/5c0/8ad/DrGolly-Teeth_Chart.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""DrGolly-Teeth_Chart.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"

1.9 Teething,Signs and Symptoms,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Excessive drooling:</strong> Increased saliva production is a common teething sign, which can sometimes lead to a rash on the chin.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Irritability:</strong> Teething can make your baby irritable, fussy, and prone to mood swings.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Chewing and biting:</strong> Babies may chew on objects or try to bite things to relieve the pressure on their gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Gum swelling and sensitivity:</strong> You may notice redness, swelling, or tenderness in your baby’s gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Sleep disturbances:</strong> Unfortunately, other teething symptoms include an extra fussy baby that can have disruptions to their regular bedtime routine. Baby wakes because teething discomfort often peaks at night, leading to disrupted sleep patterns for babies and parents – the great news is each tooth is only a 24-hour cycle, so it’s relatively short-lived (I appreciate it doesn’t feel like this when you’re in the thick of it).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Loose bowels and associated nappy rash:</strong> New teeth coming through can cause hypersalivation (excessive drooling) and therefore diarrhoea and loose bowels. Teething itself doesn't cause nappy rash, but the sensitive skin around their bottoms is more likely to be affected by diarrhoea and loose bowels.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Note:</strong> Teething will NOT increase a baby's temperature above 38 degrees. Do not attribute a temperature &gt;38 degrees to teething, there is likely a medical cause that should be evaluated.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/4fe/8a5/22f/1711426209362.png"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""1711426209362.png"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.9 Teething,Tips to Help Your Teething Baby,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 1: Chilled teething rings or teething toys</strong>Give your baby a clean, chilled teething ring, some teething toys, or a chilled damp washcloth to gnaw on. The cold sensation can reduce inflammation, help numb their gums, and provide relief. Ensure the toy or teething ring is age-appropriate and free from small parts to prevent it from becoming a choking hazard for your child.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re using a washcloth option, soak it in breastmilk or formula, make a ball, and tie a rubber band around the middle so they have something to hold onto.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 2: Gentle gum massage</strong><br>Wash your hands thoroughly and use a clean finger to massage your baby’s gums gently. This can help alleviate some of the discomfort and provide soothing relief where their teeth are coming through their gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 3: Pain relief options</strong><br>Consult your baby’s paediatrician or doctor about pain relief medications that are safe for your baby’s age. Always follow your doctor’s recommendations regarding dosage and usage.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 4: Dietary adjustments</strong><br>If your baby has started solid foods, offer cold and soft foods like yogurt, pureed fruit, or chilled cucumber. The coolness can provide relief to sore gums.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 5: Baby’s bedtime routine</strong><br>Establish a calming bedtime routine to help with nighttime fussiness that includes activities such as a warm bath, soft lullabies, and cuddling. A consistent routine signals to your baby that it’s time to sleep.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 6: Distraction</strong><br>Engage your baby in gentle play or story time before bedtime to divert their attention from teething discomfort. Distraction can help them relax and fall asleep more easily.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 7: Comfort items</strong><br>If your baby has a favourite stuffed animal or blanket, make sure it’s within reach. These comfort items can provide a sense of security. Please ensure this is age-appropriate from a SIDS/safety perspective.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 8: Monitor nighttime nappy changes</strong><br>If your baby is in discomfort due to teething, try to minimise nighttime nappy changes to avoid waking them unnecessarily. Use high-absorbency nappies to reduce the chances of leaks.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>TIP 9: Consult your paediatrician or doctor</strong><br>If your baby’s teething discomfort is severe and persists for an extended period, or if you have concerns about their sleep, don’t hesitate to consult your paediatrician or healthcare provider who can also help your baby. They can provide guidance and tips and rule out any other potential issues.</span></p>"
1.9 Teething,Why Teething Gels Aren’t Recommended,"<p><span style=""font-size: 15px"">While many of our parents used over the counter teething gels, and if you have older children you may have used it on them, recent guidelines have changed significantly when it comes to teething gels:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">Recent literature suggests that teething gels (especially those containing lidocaine) are&nbsp;<strong><em>not recommended&nbsp;</em></strong>due to the possible dosing / toxicity effects.</span></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">The evidence and literature is also not clear as to the efficacy of the gel in actually managing teething pain &nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">It is also not clear how much of the gel is being swallowed (as this is hard to control) by a baby and so there is concern about the potential adverse effects and toxicity.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">The Australian and New Zealand Society of Paediatric Dentistry also&nbsp;<em><strong>do not recommend teething gels&nbsp;</strong></em>as a solution to teething pain and a recent literature review (2020) in the</span><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1111%2Fjpc.14769"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">&nbsp;Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health</span></a><span style=""font-size: 15px"">&nbsp;also recommend against the use of the teething gels containing lidocaine</span></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">My colleagues in the US (American Academy of Paediatrics) also&nbsp;<strong><em>do not recommend teething gels&nbsp;</em></strong>for babies either&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-size: 16px""><span style=""font-size: 15px"">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia hasn’t changed guidelines in Australia but the FDA (America’s equivalent to the TGA) <em><strong>do not recommend lidocaine gels&nbsp;</strong></em>for teething relief</span></li></ul>"
"1.10 Activities, Getting out and Travelling",Getting Out,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Getting out of the house is so important for your own mental health, even if it’s just for a little walk around the block once a day. Getting out of the house between naps is great, but in this day and age, it’s unrealistic to expect new parents to be home for all naps.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">At this age, babies can still often fall asleep easily in the pram, carrier, or car seat, so I encourage you to get out and about when you can. <strong><em>Aim for at least 1-2 naps at home in their cot though,</em></strong> as from about 6 months old, movement sleep becomes much less restorative. The shorter morning nap and/or 3rd catnap are great to offer out and about.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A breathable, blackout cover and portable white noise machine can be helpful if using the pram or car seat, as we are recreating their sleep environment like at home as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There are many interactive classes available for babies to help with stimulation and development, and this is a great age to start these:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Baby sensory play</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Baby gymnastics</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Music classes</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Storytime at local libraries</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">There are also many parent-and-baby classes that focus on parents’ well-being.</span></p>"
"1.10 Activities, Getting out and Travelling",Overstimulation,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">With the best of intentions, parents often like to interact with their babies as they grow and develop, especially as they become more responsive, comical and cute!&nbsp;Just remember not to over-stimulate your child and respond quickly to tired cues and the age appropriate sleep routines.</span></p>"
"1.10 Activities, Getting out and Travelling",Flying with Babies,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A bit of preparation can go a long way when organising your travel.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Here are my top tips for flying with kids:</strong></span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s easier (&amp; cheaper) when they are younger:</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Younger babies often sleep really well on aeroplanes because of the vibrations and white noise effect of the engines. As they get older and more mobile it does get harder to get a baby to sleep soundly on an aeroplane, and having them sleep on you might be the only thing that works. Again, this is ok and won’t cause any long term habits.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Airline bassinets are for <strong>babies under the age of two</strong> (but in my experience once they are over the age of one they can have a lot of trouble fitting in these and sleeping comfortably) There are some great universal covers you can buy that fit over both prams and plane bassinets that can ben incredibly handy at recreating their sleep environment (particularly when the cabin lights are on).</span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Should I fly during the day or night?</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Depending on the length of the flight and age of your baby or child, there are pros and cons whether you decide to fly during the day or overnight. Sometimes there may not be a choice.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Flying during the day will create less stress about your baby or child sleeping and may be easier in terms of stress on the parent.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">However, flying overnight can mean your child will be less restless and won’t need to be occupied if they sleep well.</span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Adjusting to new timezones:</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Regarding the adjustment to new time-zones when travelling long distances, children who have sleeps during the day will often adjust far quicker than adults, due to the cyclical nature of their melatonin surges.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If possible, allow 1-2 days of relaxing after arrival, in order to adjust – you will probably benefit more than the kids!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The day after arrival, try to wake your baby around their usual time, even if they have had a broken night’s sleep because of jetlag. This is the best thing you can do to help get your baby acclimatised to the new time zone.</span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Medications &amp; flying:</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If electing to use medication as a sleep aid for children, it should NEVER be tried for the first time on a flight. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist and trial the medication weeks earlier to ensure there’s no allergic reaction or unexpected response; you don’t want to find this out mid-flight!</span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When you arrive try &amp; stick to your usual routine:</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">On arrival at your destination, the most important thing is to try and stick to your baby’s regular routine, without any stress if it’s difficult to adhere to, assisted naps are completely acceptable!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">On any holiday, there will be days where routine is thrown off and this is ok. If you are out and about then offer your baby their naps at their usual times. If they haven’t slept well during the day, then try your best to bring bedtime earlier to compensate.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Naps on the go will also be inevitable, such as pram or carrier naps.</span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Recreate their sleep environment as much as possible</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When setting up a sleep environment that is unfamiliar to your baby/toddler, try to recreate their usual sleep environment as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Take their cot sheet and sleeping bags from home so it smells familiar, blackout the windows the best you can, take a portable white noise machine or download an app on your phone and take any comforters/toys your baby is used to sleeping with.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is used to sleeping in their own room at home, then try your best to continue this while on holiday. Similarly, if your baby is used to sleeping next to you or in your bedroom at home, then continue this where possible.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Often small spaces like hotel rooms or tiny apartments are necessary when travelling, in this case – products such as a blackout cot tent/canopy can be so helpful, as you don’t have to blackout the entire room at nap times.</span></p><h2><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Returning home:</span></h2><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When you return home, try to get your baby back into their usual routine within 24-48 hours.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Depending on the time difference of where you have travelled to, your baby might take longer to return to their usual routine, but just do your best and use any settling techniques available to you.</span></p>"
"1.10 Activities, Getting out and Travelling",Long Car Trips with Babies,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Long car trips with babies and young children</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Long car trips with babies and young children can be very daunting for parents, and it’s understandable that some people want to avoid them altogether. However, long car trips don’t have to be painful – as long as you plan properly.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Here are some of my favorite tips for traveling long distances with babies and children:</span></h3><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Make a list &amp; ensure the trip is a team effort:</span></h4><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Don’t leave one person responsible for everything. Have a packing list that both parents tick off together.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If this is your first big trip with a baby or kids, remember it’s not as simple as packing when you were just a couple. Allow yourself plenty of time to pack the car or do the majority the day/night before. Whatever time you need to leave requires a half-hour window to get on the road – a dirty diaper or toilet demand just as you’re locking the front door is comically inevitable!</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Share the driving as much as possible.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Be kind to each other and laugh – it’s much better than arguing.</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Take into account your baby’s routine when planning the trip:</span></h4><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If confident driving in the evening, consider leaving after you’ve done their entire dinner and bath routine. They will have enough sleep debt built up to make it easier for them to fall asleep. But make sure you switch drivers regularly and get enough rest yourselves, so you’re not driving drowsy.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">A different option is heading to bed early the night before and leaving incredibly early in the morning, like 4-5 am. Transferring them into the car in their pajamas can work – this way you can get a few hours under your belt before they really wake up in time for breakfast.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Another good time to leave is at nap time. Include lots of playtime and tire them out before jumping in the car so they can sleep for the first leg of the trip.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Keep feed and meal times the same as what they’re used to – use meal times as a good chance for everyone to stop &amp; stretch their legs. Don’t be in a hurry to arrive at your destination, as this puts undue pressure on you and you lose the opportunity to make the journey a fun part of the holiday.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby hasn’t slept well, then try to have a quiet day when you arrive at your destination so they can catch up and get back on track.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Consider an early bedtime if your baby hasn’t slept well in the car.</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Focus on recreating their sleep environment:</span></h4><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Sun shades for the windows are essential.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">For younger babies, purchasing a breathable blackout cover to put over the car seat encourages a longer nap.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Continue to use some portable white noise, although sometimes just the sound and vibration of the car engine is enough to put babies to sleep.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Use any comforters or dummies they usually have, and make sure you have numerous replacements that are easily accessible.</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Keeping them occupied:</span></h4><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Make regular stops to allow your baby to have some car-free time. No matter what their age, let them move their bodies and have tummy time, practice crawling, sitting, standing, or walking.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Introduce some new toys during the trip. Different teething toys, soft books, and sensory toys will help pass the time.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">For toddlers and older kids, try and plan stops near playgrounds.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Children’s audiobooks/stories or playlists can be enjoyable for those in the back seat… listening to the Frozen soundtrack on repeat may not be enjoyable for you (!), so create time where you can listen to your own podcasts, audiobooks, or radio.</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Pack healthy snacks &amp; drinks:</span></h4><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Remember to do this for you and the kids – it’s a long day for everyone, and eating well will help you all feel better at the other end of the trip. (Breastfeeding mothers in particular need to make sure they stay hydrated and well-fed.)</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Even if you plan to stop and buy lunch, pack plenty of healthy snacks for along the way.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you’re passing food or snacks back to toddlers or kids in the back seat, always supervise closely to avoid choking hazards.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Give snacks in small portions rather than large lunchboxes – this avoids the whole lot falling at their feet, as has happened to all of us!</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Never feed a rear-facing child where you can’t supervise them eating.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Ensure everyone has a water bottle and avoid sugary drinks, as these may give your kids energy you can’t easily run off!</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Have the things you need accessible:</span></h4><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">This may sound obvious, but make sure everything you need – nappies, wipes, change mats, outfit changes, toys, snacks, water bottles, etc. – is all easy to access. It’s incredibly inconvenient when the one thing you want is at the back of the car under three suitcases!</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If you think you’ll arrive close to bedtime, make sure portacots, sleep monitors, any bedding, and pajamas/sleepsuits, etc. are easy to pull out of the car. That way, you don’t have to unpack every suitcase when you arrive. Once the kids are asleep, you can unpack the car properly.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Remember:</strong> Babies and kids drink more than milk, so if you’re anxious and cranky, they will feed off this. Try and make the car trip as enjoyable for the whole family as possible. Be well prepared, stay safe, and don’t sweat the small stuff. Broken routines will rapidly return once the journey is over and the real holiday begins.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Happy holidays!</strong></span></p>"
1.11 Daycare,Starting Daycare,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Some babies in this age group will be needing to start daycare for a variety of different reasons. Having family support or friends help out isn't always an option for some families, and many parents will need to return to work when the baby is 6-8 months old. Starting daycare is an exciting, nerve-wracking, anxiety-inducing, and stressful time for a lot of parents. Each family has a different set of circumstances, but I personally believe that daycare, whether it be in a large center with multiple rooms or a smaller family daycare, equips the infant with socialization skills and educational opportunities that help prepare them for the future. Having said that, daycare is not a necessary thing, and should you choose to have your child home until starting preschool, they will not be at any disadvantage.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Questions to ask when looking at centers/carers</strong></span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">What is your ratio of children to educators?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">How many babies do you have in the room?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Are meals/snacks provided, or do I need to supply my own? What food is offered?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Are nappies/wipes provided?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Where do the babies sleep? (Ask to see this space)</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Are you able to help my baby try and stick to the same routine he/she has at home?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If I want to visit during the day to breastfeed my baby, is there a dedicated space for this?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">What is your sick policy?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">How much time do the children get outside?</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">What are your security policies? (i.e., is there a code on the front door? Safety gate to the car park? etc.)</li></ol>"
1.11 Daycare,Daycare and Sleep Routines,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">When choosing your centre, do what you feel is right for your family and listen to your parental instinct. While doing a tour, ask questions and don’t feel shy about asking to see the space where your baby will be napping.</span><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Speak to the educators in that room about your baby’s routine and sleep-associations, to maximize the chances of maintaining your well-earned routine. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If possible, I always recommend choosing a centre or carer that has an appropriate sleep space for infants. One that is as dark as possible with white noise playing is going to help your baby sleep as much as possible while there. Of course there will be interruptions and your baby’s sleep will probably not be as good at daycare as it is at home, but it’s important to remember this is very normal.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A good centre or carer will happily try to stick to your baby’s routine as much as possible and I encourage you to write it down for them to have everyone on the same page. Having each day as consistent as possible will help your baby adjust to daycare much quicker. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>On daycare days I recommend bringing their evening bedtime forward a little earlier</strong>. Your baby has probably had a very stimulating day, interacting with little friends, exploring new play spaces, and playing with a whole bunch of new toys; this can easily make them overtired and overstimulated. Plus they may not have napped so well, so bringing bedtime earlier is the best thing you can do to set them up for a good night’s sleep and help keep on top of overtiredness.</span></p>"
1.11 Daycare,Saying Goodbyes,"<p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A lot of babies start daycare at around the time when separation anxiety is starting to peak, and this can mean drop-off becomes a very emotional experience for both parent and baby.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>My biggest piece of advice is not to sneak away when saying your goodbyes.</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Sneaking away will just create further anxiety for your baby and not help them understand what’s going on. Instead, once you have passed them to the educator, say your goodbyes and tell them you’ll be back later to pick them up. Try to be specific: ""I’ll be here as soon as you finish your afternoon snack,"" and then be sure to keep your promise.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Yes, a lot of babies will have a meltdown and be upset with you leaving, but most are totally fine within 5 minutes, and there are certainly lots of distractions to keep them busy. Most childcare centers won't mind parents calling to check in on their babies for some reassurance, and many centers these days also have technology to keep you updated with photos and information in real time on how your baby is doing, how much they've slept, and what they've eaten.</span></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/8a0/bc7/1f2/shutterstock_1293380605.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_1293380605.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.12 Bottle Refusal,Bottle Rejection and Daycare,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">A common concern for parents is bottle-refusal when starting daycare. Breastfed babies who have never taken to a bottle may not be able to drink any expressed milk or formula offered to them while they’re at daycare, and this can be very stressful for parents.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">It’s important to remember that your baby will be offered solids, either prepared by the centre or sent from home, during the day and also water with meals. If you have a baby who refuses the bottle, then ensure you offer them a breastfeed before sending them for the day and on returning. For some babies, they may wake during the night on daycare days for an extra breastfeed; this is ok.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you know your baby will be starting daycare in the coming months and this is a concern, then I suggest starting to offer a bottle sooner rather than later. There is a lot more information on bottle rejection in the next chapter.</span></p>"

There is more on this in Chapter 1.1 - Sleep Environment. A sleep trainer clock provides a visual cue to tell your child it's time to get up for the day (or get up from a nap). They're great to start using if your child is over 2-2.5 years old.&nbsp;</span></p>"
1.14 Troubleshooting,Settling Challenges,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Now that your baby is over 4 weeks old, we can begin using different techniques to help settle them to sleep. We are not insisting that they self-settle at this age though, as babies up to 12-16 weeks often still need parental reassurance and a lot of hands-on settling.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Remember:</strong><em>cry-it-out is not recommended and should always be avoided.</em> After all, they are still in the midst of the ‘fourth trimester’ until 12 weeks old.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Additional methods of settling - and resettling - babies:</span></h3><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Sleep cues like sleepy words</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Shush-pat technique</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Capped comforting</li></ul><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">1. Introducing sleepy words to your baby:</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">As part of any routine, even from this early age, both parents should find a phrase or some sleepy words that you can say to your baby as you put them down for sleep. It doesn’t have to be lengthy, but just a few words they will quickly begin to recognize as a sleep cue.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Something like “night night, it’s sleep time now, I love you” or “it’s sleepy time now, sweet dreams.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Say your sleepy words right as you pop your baby in their bassinet/cot for a sleep and repeat them once or twice before leaving them to fall asleep. If you need to resettle your baby, then repeat your sleepy words during the resettling process.</span></p><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">2. Shush-pat settling technique:</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">The shush-pat technique is useful for babies up to 4 months.</span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Make sure the baby is showing tired signs and start the nap time ritual.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Swaddle baby.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Shush baby and rock gently in your arms for a couple of minutes.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Place baby into the bassinet/cot.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Turn baby onto their side, supporting both tummy and back with each of your hands.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Continue shushing. The volume of your voice (or white noise) must match the volume of your baby’s cries if upset.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Gently pat baby in the middle of the back or on their bottom. Keep the patting at the pace of a normal heartbeat (about 60 beats per minute).</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">As baby is calmed, continue the shush-pat but slow the patting down. Continue shushing or white noise. This can take up to 20 minutes, as this is how long it takes for a baby to fall into a deep sleep state. Sometimes babies will calm but keep their eyes open. Gently stroking their nose in a downwards movement (from forehead to tip of the nose) can encourage them to close their eyes.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">DON’T STOP TOO SOON!</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Once the baby is asleep, gently roll them onto their back.</li></ol><h4><span style=""font-size: 16px"">3. Capped Comforting:</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">This is a great technique for younger babies who don’t respond well to the initial hands-on shush-pat settling technique. Every baby has a different temperament, and while some babies LOVE hands-on settling, others are less interested.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Once put to bed, and troubleshooting is complete, give them a short period of time to try and wind down themselves, but if still upset after a few minutes, then enter their room and repeat your sleep words and comfort them as needed with examples below, trying to avoid feeding.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is well-fed and showing tired signs but struggling to fall asleep, or waking shortly thereafter, begin by troubleshooting simple measures like a nappy change, temperature check, or expelling any remaining burps.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Capped comforting might look something like this:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Wrap baby in a muslin wrap with arms (not legs) swaddled firmly.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Cuddle for no more than 10 minutes until soothed, put to bed awake and without a pacifier.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Leave baby for 5 minutes, even if crying.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If awake but not screaming, try having them suck on a clean finger or pacifier.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If crying is escalating, pick up and soothe again.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Cuddle until no longer screaming, then re-settle and put to bed again.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If still awake, use the shush-pat technique to help them off to sleep.</li></ul>"
1.14 Troubleshooting,Bedtime Resistance,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">At this age, often bedtime refusal just means your baby just doesn’t have quite enough sleep debt built up, so try stretching their awake time a little longer to see if that helps things. Keep in mind the suggested routine; however, remember that every baby is a bit different, so sometimes a little trial and error is needed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong><em>Tip: ensure your baby is having a consistent wind-down routine at bedtime, as this will help teach them to anticipate bedtime and learn that it's almost time for sleep.</em></strong></span></p>"
1.14 Troubleshooting,Short Naps,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Around 12 months old, babies can begin to fight their naps and bedtime, but this is very rarely a sign that they are ready to drop to 1 nap. <strong>Most babies aren’t ready to drop to 1 nap until between 15-18 months</strong>. Continue with consistency, keeping their routine on track, and offering both naps, and you should see them resolve in 1-2 weeks. It’s ok to pop them down for their morning nap a little later (i.e., 15 mins) if they are really fighting it, as this will increase their sleep debt and should make falling asleep easier.</span></p>"
1.14 Troubleshooting,Nap Transitions,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Moving your toddler to a big bed can be an exciting transition, but can be daunting for some parents and children. <strong>Toddlers are often moved out of a cot too soon for two main reasons:</strong></span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">There’s a new baby arriving or</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Solving a sleep problem such as climbing out of the cot.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Problem:</strong> Toddlers should remain in their cot until at least 2.5-3 years, or as old as possible. Under 2.5 years old toddlers haven’t yet developed impulse control and will likely be in and out of the bed multiple times.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Solution:</strong> If a new baby is arriving then look at buying/renting a second cot as your toddler will be going through enough new changes and keeping their sleep space consistent will help the transition. If you want to transition to a big bed because your toddler can climb out of their cot then try lowering the mattress completely to the floor (i.e. take the base off the cot and have the mattress on the floor). This makes it harder for them to climb out. Also keep them in a sleeping bag if you can as this will also limit their ability to climb out. If they are able to take their own sleeping bag off then put it on backwards to restrict access to the zip/buttons. When you feel your child is ready to move to a big bed, try and have it in the same position as their cot was and get them involved in the process (i.e. letting them help choose their linen and make a big deal of them moving to a big bed).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">If you must move them to a big bed under 2.5 years old then treat their entire room as a cot and make sure their room is a safe place to be. Ensure furniture is anchored to the wall and there are no tall bookshelves or wardrobes to climb. Putting a baby gate on their bedroom door can also help if they are constantly getting in and out of their room. Sometimes a baby gate only needs to be used in the short term until they learn that their bed is safe for sleeping. Children under 2.5 years haven’t yet developed impulse control, and so this makes it difficult for them to understand the concept of staying in their bed.</span></p><p><br></p><div class=""se-component se-image-container __se__float-none""><figure><img src=""https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/331856/images/ef2/c56/d43/shutterstock_129442772.jpg"" alt="""" data-rotate="""" data-proportion=""true"" data-size="","" data-align=""none"" data-percentage=""auto,auto"" data-file-name=""shutterstock_129442772.jpg"" data-file-size=""0"" data-origin="","" style=""""></figure></div>"
1.14 Troubleshooting,Split Nights,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Split nights</strong> occur when your baby goes to sleep well in the evening but then wakes during the night and is awake for 2 or more hours before resettling back to sleep. They usually occur between the hours of 11pm and 4am. During this awake time, they can be whinging, happily babbling in their cot and practicing a new skill, or can get upset and frustrated that they aren't able to go back to sleep, especially if they've previously been able to self-soothe.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><em>Common Causes of Split Nights</em></span></p><ol><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Under-tiredness</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Hitting a big developmental milestone</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Poor napping in the day</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Too much day sleep</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">Bedtime that's too early</li></ol><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">To help resolve split nights, take a look at your baby's daytime routine (see our suggested routines earlier in this chapter).</span></p><ul><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If they are on Option B, it might be time to switch to Option A.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If they are having less than 4 hrs awake time between their lunchtime nap and bedtime, try to stretch them out here closer to 4 hrs.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is closer to 12 months old, some are able to cope with an awake time of closer to 4 hrs 15 mins before bedtime.</li><li style=""font-size: 16px"">If your baby is learning a new skill (aka reaching a new developmental milestone), make sure they have LOTS of practice during the day and aren't stuck in a pram or car seat most of the day.

1.14 Troubleshooting,FAQs - Troubleshooting,"<p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Can I alter the time I wake baby up to start their day?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> Babies set their biological clocks around the 6-week mark, so having a set wake-up time can be really helpful in establishing a routine and helping your baby sleep well during the day and at night. This wake-up time can be adjusted by 15-30 minutes if your baby has had a particularly rough night or if you know that you might have a day with lots of interruptions ahead. If your baby is unwell, then this is another scenario when it is okay to forget their set wake-up time and let them have more sleep.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: The routine says only feed every 4 hours overnight. What happens if my baby wakes up earlier than this wanting a feed?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> This is something to work towards, and we realize that some babies will wake more frequently overnight. If this happens, then try having the non-breastfeeding parent resettle baby until it is closer to the 4-hour mark, but only for 30 minutes maximum at a time. For example, if your baby wakes 3 hours after a feed, then have the non-breastfeeding parent resettle them (after offering a burp, checking the nappy, and making sure they aren't too hot or cold) for 30 minutes until offering a feed. As your baby gets older, they should be able to feed 4-hourly overnight if their calorie intake is sufficient during the day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Should I wake my baby from their naps during the day?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Yes, absolutely! If your baby is having too much sleep during the day, then it can impact night sleep. Introducing a happy wake-up will also help your baby learn to distinguish when it is time to go back to sleep and when it is time to wake up. A happy wake-up is when you quietly enter the room and wake baby up, open the blinds or turn on a light, and then make a big fuss with lots of over-the-top praise about what a good sleep they had!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px"">Your baby will learn that quiet, sleepy words such as ""night night, it's sleep time"" mean it's time to go back to sleep, whereas a happy wake-up means it's time to get up.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: Can we start our day at 6 am or 8 am if the recommended 7 am doesn't work for our family?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Absolutely! It's always okay to do what's best for your family. However, some babies do find it harder to get into a 6-6 or 8-8 routine as they get older, and this is because of natural wake windows that begin to develop around 4 months old (more on this in the Big Baby 4-8 months program). As there are times during the day when babies are primed for sleep due to temperature and hormone regulation, adjusting their routines permanently can suit some babies perfectly well, but it just may not work for others. Try your best and see how your baby responds, and remember to be consistent and persistent while you attempt the change.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: What do I do with the gaps in the routine?</strong><br>For example, in the 6-12 week routine, it suggests letting the baby have a nap for 1.5-2 hours, which would mean they are awake at around 10:30 am, then aren't due a feed until 11 am. What can we do in this time?</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>ANS:</strong> During this short period of time before they feed, feel free to let your baby have some playtime on the mat or in a bouncer, some tummy time, a brief walk outside in the pram or carrier, or some nursery rhymes and a nappy change. Anything really! If your baby wakes and is hysterically hungry, then it's okay to feed a little earlier than 11 am. This can be worked towards over time, and if your baby is used to having 3-hourly feeds, then you might want to gradually increase it to 4-hourly (as per our suggested routine) rather than stretching them all at once.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: It's really hard to put my baby down to sleep in the cot for the last brief nap of the day. What can I do about this?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> This is VERY common, and babies will often fight this nap the older they get (more about this in the Big Baby program). It's fine to offer this brief nap as an assisted one, so that means trying things like holding them, using the carrier, pram, or car seat. Our goal is for them to have a brief nap as per the routine to ensure they aren't going to bed overtired at nighttime.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby isn’t quite 6 weeks or still isn’t 5 kg. Am I okay to start the 6-week routine?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> Generally speaking, if your baby is less than 6 weeks and/or less than 5 kg, Dr. Golly doesn’t recommend starting routines. Dr. Golly really likes babies to be nice and big/robust when they start the 6-week routine with that long stretch through the night. It’s also to ensure breast milk supply has been well and truly established if that’s how your family is choosing to feed your baby.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby isn’t quite 6 weeks or still isn’t 5-6 kg but is already sleeping through the night. Am I okay to start the 6-week routine?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> See the answer above as my general response. There may be some nights when your baby will do a nice long stretch after the late night/dream feed—enjoy these! But never push a baby to stretch these feeds if they wake for that 3-4 am feed until they meet that weight requirement. Likewise, before 6 weeks and 5-6 kg, they may be more comfortable on the 3-hour rather than 4-hour stretches between feeds. Always respond to your baby until they’re that bit bigger and more robust.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px""><strong>Q: My baby is only having around 1 hr 15 mins - 1 hr 45 mins awake time; however, in the routine, it suggests stretching awake time between the last nap and bedtime to 2 hrs 15 mins. Is this correct?</strong><br><strong>ANS:</strong> We don't recommend stretching your baby if they can't yet make this awake time, and the times in the routines are a rough guide. To help keep the early evening on track, you could offer a 1-hour late afternoon nap until 5 pm and then bring bedtime earlier as needed. It's never a good idea to stretch your baby too much and make them overtired, especially at the end of the day. Remember to watch your baby, not just the clock. As your baby gets closer to 12 weeks old, having a longer awake time will be easier, but they still may not reach those exact times suggested in the routine.</span></p>"
