### üîß Required for Deployment

#### Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
# Required - Klaviyo API Integration
KLAVIYO_API_KEY=pk_your_production_klaviyo_private_key

# Feature Flags - Enable/Disable Event Types
KLAVIYO_PURCHASE_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_SUBSCRIPTION_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_CART_ABANDONED_ENABLED=true

# Optional - Cart Recovery URLs
VITE_APP_URL=https://app.drgolly.com
```

#### Klaviyo Account Requirements:
- [x] Private API key with correct scopes:
  - Events: Write access ‚úÖ
  - Profiles: Read/Write access ‚úÖ

### üöÄ Deployment Strategy

#### Phase 1: Purchase Events Only (Recommended Start)
```bash
KLAVIYO_PURCHASE_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_SUBSCRIPTION_EVENTS_ENABLED=false
KLAVIYO_CART_ABANDONED_ENABLED=false
```

#### Phase 2: Add Subscription Events  
```bash
KLAVIYO_PURCHASE_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_SUBSCRIPTION_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_CART_ABANDONED_ENABLED=false
```

#### Phase 3: Full Deployment
```bash
KLAVIYO_PURCHASE_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_SUBSCRIPTION_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
KLAVIYO_CART_ABANDONED_ENABLED=true
```

### üìä Event Data Parsing Verification

#### Purchase Events ("Placed Order")
- ‚úÖ Triggered by: Stripe payment completion webhooks
- ‚úÖ Data captured: Order ID, customer email, total, currency, items, payment method
- ‚úÖ Customer profile: Auto-created with purchase history
- ‚úÖ Integration point: `server/routes.ts` line 6508-6520

#### Subscription Events ("Subscription Started")  
- ‚úÖ Triggered by: Stripe subscription creation webhooks
- ‚úÖ Data captured: Subscription ID, plan tier, billing period, amounts, dates
- ‚úÖ Customer profile: Updated with subscription status and tier
- ‚úÖ Integration point: `server/routes.ts` line 6569-6587

#### Cart Abandonment Events ("Abandoned Checkout")
- ‚úÖ Triggered by: Cart API updates (add, update, remove)
- ‚úÖ Data captured: Cart total, items, abandonment timestamp, recovery URL
- ‚úÖ Customer profile: Updated with cart data for targeting
- ‚úÖ Integration points: `server/routes.ts` cart endpoints (multiple locations)

### üîç Deployment Verification Steps

1. **Environment Setup**: Add Klaviyo API key to production environment
2. **Feature Flag Start**: Begin with purchase events only
3. **Test Purchase**: Complete a course purchase and verify "Placed Order" event in Klaviyo
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for "Klaviyo purchase event sent successfully" messages
5. **Customer Verification**: Check customer profile created correctly in Klaviyo dashboard
6. **Gradual Rollout**: Add subscription and cart events after purchase validation
7. **Full Testing**: Verify all three event types working correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Measures in Place

- **Non-blocking**: All Klaviyo operations are asynchronous and won't impact user experience
- **Error Handling**: Failed Klaviyo events are logged but don't break core functionality
- **Retry Logic**: Worker queue automatically retries failed events with exponential backoff
- **Feature Flags**: Can instantly disable any event type without code deployment
- **Rollback Ready**: Can disable all events immediately if issues arise

### üéØ Success Criteria

- Purchase events appear in Klaviyo within 30 seconds of payment completion
- Subscription events appear when new subscriptions are created via Stripe
- Cart abandonment events trigger on cart modifications
- Customer profiles automatically created/updated with correct data
- Zero impact on core application performance and functionality
- Error rate below 1% for all Klaviyo operations

### üìû Support Contacts

- **Technical Issues**: Check server logs and feature flag configuration
- **Klaviyo Account**: Verify API key permissions and account settings  
- **Event Data**: Review TypeScript schemas and event mapping
- **Performance**: Monitor non-blocking operation and retry patterns

**STATUS: READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** ‚úÖ

All components implemented, tested, and documented. Gradual rollout strategy recommended starting with purchase events, then subscription events, finally cart abandonment tracking.
