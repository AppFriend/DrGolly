```

### Step 2: Access Rollback Interface
1. Open Replit workspace
2. Look for "View Checkpoints" button in chat interface

4. Select savepoint: "Stable prior to 50 users migrated - 09/08"

### Step 3: Execute Rollback

4. Allow system to restart completely

### Step 4: Post-Rollback Verification
Run these tests immediately after rollback:

- [ ] Test user login (if available)
- [ ] Session persistence check

#### Core Functionality Test
- [ ] Course content loads properly
- [ ] Admin panel accessible and functional
- [ ] Payment processing test transaction
- [ ] Database queries responding normally

#### System Health Check
- [ ] All API endpoints responding
- [ ] Database connection stable
- [ ] External integrations working (Stripe, Klaviyo, Slack)
- [ ] Error logs clear of critical issues

### Step 5: Issue Documentation
Create incident report with:
- **Migration start time**
- **Error occurrence time** 
- **Number of users migrated before error**
- **Specific error details and screenshots**
- **Rollback completion time**
- **Post-rollback verification results**

## 🔍 Migration Monitoring Checklist

### Real-Time Monitoring During Migration
Monitor these metrics every 10 users migrated:

```
User Authentication Success Rate: ____%

```

### Red Flag Indicators

- Family sharing connections break
- Admin panel becomes unresponsive (>5 seconds)
- Database queries exceed 1000ms consistently
